# Consult Agent Optimization - PAUSED

**Status**: Optimization work is temporarily paused to stabilize development environment
**Date**: 2025-08-08
**Priority**: Get back to stable, working development state

## What Was Happening

We were implementing a comprehensive optimization system for the `consult_agent` that included:

- **Quality-driven parameters** (`low`, `normal`, `better`, `best`)
- **Modular orchestration** (Gatekeeper → Consult → Critic loop)
- **Structured JSON outputs** with automatic formatting
- **File saving system** with auto-detection
- **Research agent integration** (stubbed)
- **Multi-critic systems** and tournament approaches

## Current Problems

- **NameError**: `save_path` not defined in ConsultAgentTool.execute
- **AttributeError**: Missing `_analyze_request_for_optimal_parameters` method
- **Import conflicts** between legacy and optimized agents
- **Parameter mismatches** between old and new interfaces

## What We Reverted

1. **Disabled orchestration flags** in `.cursor/mcp.json`:
   - `ACCF_ORCHESTRATION_ENABLED`
   - `ACCF_GATEKEEPER_ENABLED`
   - `ACCF_RESEARCH_ENABLED`
   - `ACCF_CRITIC_LOOP_ENABLED`

2. **System now uses legacy path**: Direct to `consult_agent_comprehensive.py`

## Current Stable State

- ✅ **MCP server**: Running with legacy ConsultAgentTool
- ✅ **Basic consult_agent**: Should work with simple prompts
- ✅ **Development environment**: Ready for other work

## Files Created During Optimization (Available for Future Resume)

### Core Implementation
- `apps/ACCF/src/accf/agents/consult_agent_optimized.py`
- `apps/ACCF/src/accf/agents/response_schemas.py`
- `apps/ACCF/src/accf/agents/response_handlers.py`
- `apps/ACCF/src/accf/agents/file_saving_system.py`

### Orchestration Layer
- `apps/ACCF/src/accf/orchestrator/core/orchestrator.py`
- `apps/ACCF/src/accf/orchestrator/tools/consult_tool.py`
- `apps/ACCF/src/accf/orchestrator/clients/` (gatekeeper, critic, research)

### Optimization Systems
- `unified_optimization_system.py`
- `multi_critic_system.py`
- `multi_candidate_tournament.py`

### Documentation
- `apps/ACCF/docs/consult_agent_architecture.md`
- Various specification docs in `apps/ACCF/docs/`

## Next Steps (When Ready to Resume)

1. **Fix parameter extraction** in ConsultAgentTool.execute
2. **Resolve import conflicts** between legacy/optimized agents
3. **Test orchestration flow** step by step
4. **Implement missing shim methods**
5. **Gradual re-enablement** of orchestration features

## Development Priority

**Current focus**: Get development environment stable and working for other tasks.
**Optimization work**: Can resume later when there's dedicated time for debugging complex integration issues.

*This pause allows productive development work to continue while the optimization system is refined offline.*
