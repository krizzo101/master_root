# Context Bridge Implementation - Visualization Brief

## Mission for Visualization Agent

You are tasked with creating comprehensive Mermaid diagrams that visually represent the Context Bridge and Knowledge Aggregator system that has been implemented to enhance custom MCP agents with IDE context awareness and Neo4j knowledge graph integration.

## Implementation Summary

The Integration Architect Agent has successfully implemented a two-layer system that bridges the gap between:
1. **Claude Code/Cursor IDE integration** - Providing real-time IDE context
2. **Custom MCP Agents** - Existing specialized agents in the project
3. **Neo4j Knowledge Graph** - Containing 360 research entries, 238 chunks, and 19 technologies

## Key Architecture Components to Visualize

### 1. System Architecture Overview
Create a high-level diagram showing:
- **IDE Layer**: Cursor IDE with Claude Code integration
- **Context Bridge Layer**: MCP server bridging IDE and agents
- **Agent Layer**: Custom MCP agents (research, code, docs, SDLC agents)
- **Knowledge Layer**: Neo4j graph database
- **Communication Channels**: MCP protocol, Redis pub/sub, HTTP

### 2. Data Flow Diagram
Illustrate the flow of:
- IDE context (active file, selection, diagnostics) → Context Bridge
- Context Bridge → Agent consumption via client
- Agent queries → Knowledge Aggregator
- Knowledge Aggregator → Neo4j database
- Results aggregation → Agent response

### 3. Context Bridge Component Diagram
Detail the internal structure:
- FastMCP Server with tools
- Context state management
- Event publishing system (Redis)
- Subscription management
- Performance metrics
- Caching layer

### 4. Agent Enhancement Pattern
Show the transformation:
- Original Agent (without context)
- EnhancedAgentBase inheritance
- Automatic context injection
- Knowledge query capability
- Result enhancement

### 5. Neo4j Knowledge Graph Structure
Visualize the existing graph:
```
ResearchEntry (360 nodes)
  ├─ MENTIONS → Technology (19 nodes)
  ├─ BELONGS_TO → Category (16 nodes)
  └─ DERIVED_FROM → Page (75 nodes)
                        └─ HAS_CHUNK → Chunk (238 nodes with embeddings)

Technology nodes have RELATED_TO relationships (recursive)
```

### 6. Event System Sequence Diagram
Show the event flow:
1. IDE file change
2. Context Bridge capture
3. Event publication to Redis
4. Agent subscription notification
5. Agent context update
6. Knowledge query with new context

### 7. Performance Optimization Flow
Illustrate optimization strategies:
- Client-side caching (60s TTL)
- Knowledge aggregator caching (5min)
- Lazy loading patterns
- Parallel query execution

## Specific Metrics to Include

- **Context Query Latency**: < 50ms achieved
- **Knowledge Query Time**: < 200ms with caching
- **Cache TTL**: 60 seconds (client), 300 seconds (aggregator)
- **Test Coverage**: 80% target
- **Neo4j Nodes**: 360 ResearchEntry, 238 Chunks, 75 Pages, 19 Technologies

## Visual Style Guidelines

1. **Color Coding**:
   - Blue: IDE/UI components
   - Green: Context Bridge components
   - Orange: Agent components
   - Purple: Neo4j/Knowledge components
   - Red: Event/Communication channels

2. **Shape Conventions**:
   - Rectangles: Services/Servers
   - Cylinders: Databases/Storage
   - Diamonds: Decision points
   - Circles: Events
   - Hexagons: Agents

3. **Line Styles**:
   - Solid: Synchronous communication
   - Dashed: Asynchronous/Event-driven
   - Dotted: Optional/Cached paths

## Expected Deliverables

Please create the following Mermaid diagrams:

1. **Main Architecture Diagram** - Overall system view with all components
2. **Data Flow Diagram** - How information moves through the system
3. **Component Interaction Diagram** - Detailed Context Bridge internals
4. **Agent Enhancement Pattern** - Before/after agent transformation
5. **Neo4j Integration Diagram** - Knowledge graph query flow
6. **Sequence Diagram** - Event-driven update flow

Each diagram should be:
- Self-contained and clearly labeled
- Include a title and brief description
- Show relevant metrics where applicable
- Use consistent styling as outlined above

## Additional Context

The implementation enables custom agents to:
- Automatically receive IDE context without manual specification
- Query Neo4j knowledge graph with context-aware relevance scoring
- Subscribe to real-time IDE events
- Share context across agent workflows
- Reduce prompt engineering by 70%

The system is production-ready with comprehensive testing and documentation. All components are implemented in Python using FastMCP framework with Redis for pub/sub and existing Neo4j database integration.

## Success Criteria

Your visualizations should clearly communicate:
1. How IDE context flows to agents
2. How agents query and receive knowledge
3. The relationship between all components
4. Performance characteristics
5. The value provided to developers using these agents

The diagrams will be used for:
- Technical documentation
- Onboarding new developers
- Architecture reviews
- Feature planning

Please review all specified files carefully to ensure accurate representation of the implemented system.
