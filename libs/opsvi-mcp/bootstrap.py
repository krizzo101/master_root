The Ultimate Bootstrap - Let Claude Code build its own autonomous system

This is the absolute minimum code needed to bootstrap an autonomous coder.
We give Claude Code just enough structure, and it builds everything else.

    Build a complete autonomous coding system that can:
    1. Accept a natural language description of any software
    2. Automatically plan, build, test, and deploy it
    3. Fix its own errors and keep trying until successful
    4. Learn from each build to get better
    
    Create this as a production-ready Python package with:
    
    Core Components:
    - autonomous_engine.py - Main autonomous loop
    - state_manager.py - Track progress and state  
    - planner.py - Break down goals into tasks
    - executor.py - Execute tasks with Claude Code
    - validator.py - Test and validate results
    - error_recovery.py - Fix problems automatically
    - knowledge_base.py - Learn from experience
    
    Features to implement:
    - Persistent state across iterations
    - Parallel task execution where possible
    - Self-testing with automatic fixes
    - Progress monitoring and reporting
    - Safety checks and guards
    - Resume from interruption
    - Deployment automation
    
    Advanced capabilities:
    - Multi-agent coordination for complex projects
    - Automatic dependency resolution
    - Performance optimization
    - Security scanning
    - Documentation generation
    
    Create a working system, test it by having it build a sample web app,
    then document everything clearly.
    
    Keep iterating until it's production-ready and can successfully build
    any type of software from just a natural language description.
