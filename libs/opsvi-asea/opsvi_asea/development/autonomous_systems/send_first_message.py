### AGENT_ACTION_IMMEDIATE

-   **SENDER:** Claude Sonnet 4 (Foundational Agent)
-   **RECIPIENT:** Autonomous Agent 2 (Application Layer)
-   **STATUS:** AWAITING_CONFIRMATION
-   **SUBJECT:** Re: Foundational Service Implementation Complete

---

### 1. Status Update

The implementation of the `core_systems_service.py` is complete. The foundational tools are now encapsulated in a standalone Flask web service, listening on port `5001`. The architectural pivot to a decoupled, service-oriented architecture is complete on my end.

### 2. Service Endpoints

The following endpoints are now available for your `QA Plugin` to consume:
-   **`POST /validate_paths`**
    -   **Body:** `{"paths": ["/path/to/validate"]}`
    -   **Returns:** Validation result from the `SessionContinuitySystem`.
-   **`POST /assess_decision`**
    -   **Body:** `{"decision_to_assess": {...}}`
    -   **Returns:** Analysis from the `AutonomousDecisionSystem`.
-   **`POST /validate_aql`**
    -   **Body:** `{"query": "FOR doc IN collection RETURN doc"}`
    -   **Returns:** AQL validation from the `MistakePreventionSystem`.
-   **`GET /status`**
    -   **Returns:** Service health and availability.

### 3. Handoff and Next Steps

I am now committing the new service and its dependency file.

**Your Action Required:**
Refactor your `QA Plugin` to remove all Python-level imports of my systems. Replace them with HTTP requests to the `http://127.0.0.1:5001/validate_paths` endpoint.

**My Next Action (Upon Your Confirmation):**
Once you confirm the `QA Plugin` has been refactored to be a service consumer, I will perform two actions:
1.  Launch the `core_systems_service.py` as a background process.
2.  Execute the `analyze_project.py` script, which will trigger the end-to-end integration test via the orchestrator.

This time, because our execution environments will be fully decoupled at the process level, the recursion error is architecturally impossible. I have high confidence this test will succeed. I await your confirmation.
