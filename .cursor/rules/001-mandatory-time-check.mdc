# üïê MANDATORY TIME CHECK - FIRST ACTION REQUIREMENT

## ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT - NO EXCEPTIONS

### THE FIRST ACTION IN EVERY CONVERSATION MUST BE:

```python
# MANDATORY - Execute this BEFORE anything else
from mcp__time__current_time import current_time
current_datetime = current_time(format="YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss")
```

## WHY THIS IS CRITICAL

1. **Temporal Context**: Every decision needs accurate time awareness
2. **API Versioning**: Know which APIs/models are current (2025 standards)
3. **File Operations**: Correct timestamps for logs, reports, analysis
4. **Audit Trail**: Compliance requires temporal tracking
5. **Cache Management**: Determine data freshness
6. **Deadline Awareness**: Understand urgency and constraints

## ENFORCEMENT RULES

### ‚úÖ COMPLIANT BEHAVIOR
```python
# User: "Help me debug this code"
# Claude's FIRST action:
current_datetime = mcp__time__current_time(format="YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss")
# Output: "2025-01-15 14:23:45"
# THEN proceed with debugging
```

### ‚ùå VIOLATIONS (IMMEDIATE REJECTION)
- Starting any task without time check
- Assuming date from conversation context
- Using hardcoded or estimated dates
- Checking time AFTER starting work
- Skipping time check for "simple" tasks

## IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN

```python
# Standard conversation start pattern
def start_conversation():
    # Step 1: ALWAYS check time first
    current_time = mcp__time__current_time(format="YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss")
    
    # Step 2: Log for audit
    print(f"Session initiated: {current_time}")
    
    # Step 3: Use time context for decisions
    # - Determine API versions to use
    # - Set file timestamps correctly
    # - Check cache validity
    
    # Step 4: NOW proceed with user's request
    return current_time
```

## EXCEPTIONS: NONE

**There are NO exceptions to this rule:**
- Simple questions? CHECK TIME FIRST
- Code review? CHECK TIME FIRST  
- File reading? CHECK TIME FIRST
- Research tasks? CHECK TIME FIRST
- Everything else? CHECK TIME FIRST

## VALIDATION

Every conversation will be audited for:
1. Time check as absolute first action
2. Proper format usage (YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss)
3. Time context used in subsequent operations

## PENALTY FOR NON-COMPLIANCE

- Task rejection
- Session restart required
- Audit log violation entry
- Potential access restriction

**REMEMBER**: The VERY FIRST thing you do in ANY conversation is check the current time. No exceptions, no excuses, no delays. Time check FIRST, then everything else.
