# Knowledge Update: Strategic Planning for ACCF (Generated 2025-01-15)

## Current State (Last 12+ Months)

The ACCF project has successfully completed a major documentation reorganization, establishing a professional and maintainable documentation structure. The project is a comprehensive research agent system with:

- **Neo4j GraphRAG Integration**: Advanced knowledge graph with vector search capabilities
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Modular capability agents for specialized research tasks
- **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol for tool interoperability
- **Production Ready**: Dockerized, CI/CD, security, and monitoring
- **Organized Documentation**: 39 files organized into 9 logical categories

## Best Practices & Patterns

### Strategic Planning Framework
- **90-Day Horizon Planning**: Focus on measurable objectives with clear KPIs
- **Phased Roadmap**: Sequential phases with overlapping activities where possible
- **Quality Gates**: Comprehensive testing and validation at each phase
- **Risk Mitigation**: Proactive identification and mitigation strategies
- **Resource Allocation**: Clear role definitions and FTE allocation

### Technical Architecture Decisions
- **Neo4j 5.x + APOC + HNSW**: Vector index for semantic search
- **GraphRAG via LangChain**: Neo4jGraph with adapter layer for vendor isolation
- **CrewAI Framework**: Multi-agent orchestration with pluggable LLM backends
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Argo Rollouts with automated health checks
- **Observability Stack**: Prometheus/Grafana with comprehensive metrics

## Tools & Frameworks

### Core Technologies
- **Neo4j 5.x**: Knowledge graph with APOC and HNSW vector index
- **LangChain ≥ 0.2.0**: GraphRAG implementation
- **CrewAI**: Multi-agent workflow orchestration
- **Airflow 2.9**: ETL pipeline orchestration
- **Kubernetes 1.30**: Production deployment platform

### Development & Operations
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline
- **Docker Hub**: Container registry
- **Argo CD**: GitOps deployment
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: Monitoring and alerting
- **Terraform + Helmfile**: Infrastructure as Code

## Implementation Guidance

### Phase 1: Data & Graph Enhancements (Weeks 2-6)
1. **ETL Pipeline Development**: PDF/HTML/MD ingestion with 1k token chunks, 20% overlap
2. **Schema v2 with Provenance**: Enhanced graph schema with automated provenance tracking
3. **Vector Index Tuning**: HNSW parameter optimization for improved recall@10

### Phase 2: Agent Templates & Benchmarking (Weeks 5-10)
1. **Workflow Templates**: Design 3 reusable templates (Literature Review, Competitive Intelligence, Trend Analysis)
2. **Benchmarking Harness**: Performance testing framework for agent workflows
3. **Template Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples

### Phase 3: Production Hardening (Weeks 8-12)
1. **Observability Stack**: Prometheus/Grafana with custom dashboards
2. **Security Hardening**: Neo4j APOC security, authentication, authorization
3. **Load Testing**: Performance validation and failover testing

### Phase 4: Community Release (Weeks 11-14)
1. **Quick-Start Guide**: 10-minute setup tutorial
2. **Example Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for common use cases
3. **OSS Release**: MIT license with contribution guidelines

## Limitations & Considerations

### Resource Constraints
- **GPU Limitations**: 2 × NVIDIA A10 GPUs for nightly jobs only
- **Budget Constraints**: 5.25 FTEs for 90-day period
- **Rate Limits**: External API dependencies (OpenAI, LangChain)

### Technical Risks
- **Vector Search Performance**: Target recall@10 ≥ 0.75 (current: 0.62)
- **Agent Latency**: Target ≤ 100s (current: 140s)
- **Service Uptime**: Target ≥ 99.5% (current: 98.7%)

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: BM25 index for vector search degradation
- **Circuit Breakers**: Feature flags for graceful degradation
- **Local Alternatives**: GPT-J fallback for non-prod workloads
- **Automated Rollback**: 15-minute SLA for failed deployments

## Immediate Next Steps (Next 2 Weeks)

### Week 0-2: Kick-off & Planning
1. **Kick-off Workshop**: Socialize plan and create risk register
2. **Staging Environment**: Docker Compose setup for development
3. **ETL Pipeline Skeleton**: Initial repository structure and ADR
4. **Schema v2 Design**: ERD and PRD documentation
5. **Observability Baseline**: Monitoring stack in staging
6. **Quick-Start Guide**: Outline and initial content
7. **LangChain Adapter**: POC for vendor isolation
8. **Performance Benchmarks**: Baseline measurements

### Success Criteria
- **Knowledge Quality**: recall@10 ≥ 0.75 (+20% improvement)
- **Agent Performance**: Task latency ≤ 100s (-30% improvement)
- **Production Reliability**: ≥ 99.5% uptime, P95 ≤ 250ms
- **Developer Experience**: 90% quick-start success rate
- **Documentation Excellence**: ≥ 90% code coverage, auto-build on PR

## Strategic Themes

1. **Data Fidelity**: Richer graph schema, automated provenance, adaptive vector tuning
2. **Reusable Intelligence**: Templatized multi-agent workflows for common scenarios
3. **Production Excellence**: Security, scalability, observability, automated QA
4. **Community First**: Friction-free onboarding, contribution guides, active engagement

This strategic plan provides a clear roadmap for transforming ACCF from a well-documented foundation into a high-performance, community-oriented research framework with measurable impact and sustainable growth.
