## Limitations & Considerations

### Current Limitations
- **Processing Speed**: Some collectors are very slow (99s for integrations)
- **Limited Context**: No cross-file relationship analysis
- **Static Analysis Only**: No runtime behavior analysis
- **Basic Security**: Limited to bandit's capabilities
- **No Fix Suggestions**: Analysis only, no remediation guidance

### Technical Considerations
- **Memory Usage**: Large projects may exceed available RAM
- **Network Dependencies**: External tool availability affects reliability
- **False Positives**: Need validation mechanisms for LLM outputs
- **Scalability**: Current architecture may not scale to enterprise codebases
- **Maintenance**: External tool updates may break integrations

### Security Considerations
- **Code Exposure**: Analysis of sensitive code requires careful handling
- **Authentication**: Secure access to private repositories
- **Data Privacy**: Protection of analysis results and metadata
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging for compliance
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for different analysis levels

### Integration Challenges
- **Tool Compatibility**: Ensuring all external tools work together
- **Version Management**: Handling different versions of analysis tools
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when tools fail
- **Performance Impact**: Minimizing overhead on development workflows
- **User Experience**: Making complex analysis accessible to developers
