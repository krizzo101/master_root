## Best Practices & Patterns

### Collaborative AI Workflow Design
1. **Session Continuity**: Maintain persistent context across interactions
2. **Proactive Anticipation**: Identify patterns and predict next actions
3. **Shared Mental Models**: Develop common understanding of goals and preferences
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously improve based on user feedback
5. **Tool Orchestration**: Coordinate multiple MCP tools for comprehensive solutions

### Anticipatory System Principles
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learn user behavior patterns and preferences
- **Context Awareness**: Understand current situation and historical context
- **Proactive Suggestions**: Offer solutions before problems arise
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously refine understanding based on interactions
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential problems before they occur

## Tools & Frameworks

### Current MCP Tools Available
- **Web Research**: Brave search, web scraping, research papers
- **Technical Docs**: Context7 library documentation
- **Database**: Neo4j graph operations
- **AI Reasoning**: o3_agent for advanced problem-solving
- **System Tools**: Time, shell execution, calculations, thinking

### Collaboration Frameworks

## Implementation Guidance

### Tag-Team Collaboration Strategy
1. **Research Phase**: Use MCP tools to gather current information
2. **Analysis Phase**: Use thinking tools to identify patterns and problems
3. **Planning Phase**: Use o3_agent to design optimal solutions
4. **Execution Phase**: Implement with continuous monitoring and adaptation
5. **Refinement Phase**: Learn from outcomes and improve future interactions

### Proactive Problem Identification
- **Pattern Analysis**: Identify recurring issues or inefficiencies
- **Context Scanning**: Monitor for potential problems in current situation
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate likelihood and impact of potential issues
- **Preventive Action**: Take steps to avoid problems before they occur
- **Continuous Learning**: Update understanding based on outcomes

## Limitations & Considerations

### Current Limitations
- **Session Memory**: MCP sessions are temporary and may be lost on restart
- **Context Boundaries**: Limited to available MCP tools and data sources
- **Learning Curve**: Requires time to develop effective collaboration patterns
- **Tool Dependencies**: Effectiveness depends on quality of available MCP tools

### Important Considerations
- **Privacy & Security**: Ensure secure handling of user data and preferences
- **Ethical Boundaries**: Maintain appropriate limits on proactive actions
- **User Control**: Always allow user override of anticipatory actions
- **Transparency**: Make reasoning and decision-making process clear
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Have backup approaches when anticipatory systems fail
