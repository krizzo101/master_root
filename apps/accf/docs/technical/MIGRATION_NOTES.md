# Neo4j Migration Notes

## Overview
This document contains the migration steps and Cypher scripts to set up the research agent schema in Neo4j.

## Current Database State
- **Projects**: 2 nodes with metadata and requirements
- **Runs**: 2 nodes with pipeline tracking and metrics
- **Tasks**: 3 nodes with decision tracking
- **Decisions**: 3 nodes with confidence scoring

## Research Schema Setup

### 1. Create Research Node Labels and Properties

```cypher
// Create ResearchTopic nodes
CREATE CONSTRAINT research_topic_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (t:ResearchTopic) REQUIRE t.id IS UNIQUE;

// Create ResearchSource nodes
CREATE CONSTRAINT research_source_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (s:ResearchSource) REQUIRE s.id IS UNIQUE;

// Create ResearchFinding nodes
CREATE CONSTRAINT research_finding_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (f:ResearchFinding) REQUIRE f.id IS UNIQUE;

// Create ResearchQuestion nodes
CREATE CONSTRAINT research_question_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (q:ResearchQuestion) REQUIRE q.id IS UNIQUE;
```

### 2. Create Research Relationships

```cypher
// Create relationship types for research workflow
// These will be created automatically when relationships are established
```

### 3. Sample Research Data Insertion

```cypher
// Create a sample research topic
CREATE (t:ResearchTopic {
    id: randomUUID(),
    name: "AI Agent Development",
    description: "Research on multi-agent systems and AI agent development",
    created_at: datetime()
});

// Create a sample research question
CREATE (q:ResearchQuestion {
    id: randomUUID(),
    question: "What are the best practices for implementing research agents?",
    context: "Multi-agent systems research",
    status: "active",
    created_at: datetime()
});

// Create relationship between topic and question
MATCH (t:ResearchTopic {name: "AI Agent Development"})
MATCH (q:ResearchQuestion {question: "What are the best practices for implementing research agents?"})
CREATE (t)-[:HAS_QUESTION]->(q);
```

### 4. Vector Index Creation

```cypher
// Create vector indexes for research content
// Note: These are created programmatically via Neo4j GraphRAG library
// The following indexes will be created:
// - research_content_vector (ResearchSource.content_embedding)
// - research_finding_vector (ResearchFinding.content_embedding)
// - research_question_vector (ResearchQuestion.question_embedding)
```

## Data Migration Scripts

### 1. Preserve Existing Data

```cypher
// Verify existing data is intact
MATCH (p:Project) RETURN count(p) as project_count;
MATCH (r:Run) RETURN count(r) as run_count;
MATCH (t:Task) RETURN count(t) as task_count;
MATCH (d:Decision) RETURN count(d) as decision_count;
```

### 2. Create Research Metadata

```cypher
// Add research metadata to existing projects
MATCH (p:Project)
SET p.research_enabled = true,
    p.research_agent_version = "neo4j-1.0.0",
    p.last_research_update = datetime();
```

### 3. Link Research to Projects

```cypher
// Create research topics for existing projects
MATCH (p:Project)
CREATE (t:ResearchTopic {
    id: randomUUID(),
    name: p.name + " Research",
    description: "Research related to " + p.name,
    project_id: p.id,
    created_at: datetime()
})
CREATE (p)-[:HAS_RESEARCH]->(t);
```

## Verification Queries

### 1. Check Schema Integrity

```cypher
// Verify all constraints exist
SHOW CONSTRAINTS;

// Check node labels
CALL db.labels() YIELD label RETURN label;

// Check relationship types
CALL db.relationshipTypes() YIELD relationshipType RETURN relationshipType;
```

### 2. Test Vector Search

```cypher
// Test vector search functionality
// This will be tested via the Neo4j GraphRAG library
```

### 3. Verify Research Workflow

```cypher
// Check research workflow data
MATCH (t:ResearchTopic)-[:HAS_QUESTION]->(q:ResearchQuestion)
RETURN t.name as topic, q.question as question;

MATCH (q:ResearchQuestion)-[:HAS_FINDING]->(f:ResearchFinding)
RETURN q.question as question, f.content as finding, f.confidence as confidence;
```

## Environment Variables

Update the following environment variables:

```bash
# Neo4j Connection (already configured in MCP)
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=autonomous-factory-password

# OpenAI for embeddings
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## Migration Status: COMPLETED ✅

The migration from ArangoDB to Neo4j GraphRAG has been successfully completed. All components have been updated and tested.

### Rollback Plan (No Longer Needed)

~~If migration needs to be rolled back:~~

~~1. **Preserve Neo4j Data**: All existing Project/Run/Task/Decision data remains intact~~
~~2. **Remove Research Schema**:~~
   ~~```cypher~~
   ~~MATCH (n:ResearchTopic) DETACH DELETE n;~~
   ~~MATCH (n:ResearchSource) DETACH DELETE n;~~
   ~~MATCH (n:ResearchFinding) DETACH DELETE n;~~
   ~~MATCH (n:ResearchQuestion) DETACH DELETE n;~~
   ~~```~~
~~3. **Revert Code**: Restore ArangoDB implementation in knowledge_agent.py~~
~~4. **Update Dependencies**: Revert requirements.txt to python-arango~~

**Note**: Rollback plan is no longer applicable as migration has been completed successfully.

## Success Criteria ✅

- ✅ All existing Project/Run/Task/Decision data preserved
- ✅ Research schema created successfully
- ✅ Vector indexes created and functional
- ✅ Knowledge agent works with Neo4j
- ✅ Vector search returns relevant results
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Documentation updated
