## ðŸš€ Integration with o3_agent

### **Current State**
The o3_agent tool currently requires users to manually specify the model:
```python
result = o3_agent_consult(
    prompt="Design a system architecture",
    model="gpt-4.1-nano",  # Manual selection required
    artifact_type="answer"
)
```

### **Proposed Integration**
Make the `model` parameter optional and use intelligent selection:
```python
result = o3_agent_consult(
    prompt="Design a system architecture",
    # model parameter becomes optional - system auto-selects
    artifact_type="answer"
)
```

### **Implementation Steps**
1. **Integrate Decision Engine**: Add model selection to o3_agent tool
2. **Update API**: Make `model` parameter optional with intelligent defaults
3. **Add Logging**: Track model selections for optimization
4. **User Feedback**: Allow users to override when needed
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Track actual vs. predicted performance

## ðŸ“‹ Usage Examples

### **Basic Usage**
```python
from model_selection_engine import select_optimal_model

# Simple usage - just provide a prompt
prompt = "Create user stories for a healthcare appointment booking system"
decision = select_optimal_model(prompt)

print(f"Selected Model: {decision.selected_model}")
print(f"Reasoning: {decision.reasoning}")
print(f"Confidence: {decision.confidence_score}")
```

### **Advanced Usage**
```python
from model_selection_engine import create_task_context, ModelSelectionEngine

# Create task context with explicit parameters
context = create_task_context(
    prompt_text="Design a microservices architecture",
    task_type="system_architecture",
    time_constraint="urgent",
    quality_requirement="overview",
    complexity_level="moderate"
)

# Get model selection
engine = ModelSelectionEngine()
decision = engine.select_model(context)
```

### **User Override**
```python
# Override the automatic selection if needed
decision = select_optimal_model(
    prompt="Create a system design",
    user_override="gpt-4.1-mini"  # Force specific model
)
```
