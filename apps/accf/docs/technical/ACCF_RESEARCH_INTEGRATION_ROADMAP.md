# ACCF Research Agent Integration Roadmap

**Generated**: 2025-07-30
**Based on**: o3 Agent Analysis & Comprehensive Code Review
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

## Executive Summary

The ACCF project has a **sophisticated but fragmented research implementation**. The current research agent is basic (54 lines) while advanced capabilities exist in the reference implementation. This roadmap provides a **14-week phased approach** to integrate advanced research capabilities while preserving existing Neo4j knowledge graph integration.

## Current State Analysis

### âœ… **What Exists and Works**
- **Neo4j Knowledge Graph**: Production-ready with vector search (412 lines)
- **Knowledge Agent**: Full GraphRAG integration (239 lines)
- **MCP Infrastructure**: Server configured and functional
- **Basic Research Agent**: Simple LLM-based (54 lines)

### ðŸ”„ **What Needs Integration**
- **Advanced Research Agent**: MCP tool orchestration (90 lines)
- **11-Stage Workflow**: Comprehensive research process (218 lines)
- **MCP Tools**: Brave search, Firecrawl, ArXiv, Context7
- **Quality Assurance**: Research validation and curation

## Architectural Strategy

### **Adapter + Feature Flag Approach**
```python
# Interface for research engines
class IResearchEngine:
    async def answer_question(self, question: str) -> ResearchResponse
    async def answer_question_using_llm(self, question: str) -> ResearchResponse

# Current basic implementation
class BasicResearchEngine(IResearchEngine):
    # Preserve existing functionality

# New advanced implementation
class AdvancedResearchPipeline(IResearchEngine):
    # Integrate reference implementation capabilities
```

### **Layered Module Structure**
```

## Immediate Next Actions

### **Week 1 Priorities**
1. **Schedule discovery workshops** - PM
2. **Draft ADR-001 (IResearchEngine)** - Architect
3. **Provision dev Neo4j instance** - DevOps
4. **Kick-off security threat modeling** - Security Eng

### **Open Questions**
1. Final list of MCP tools (Context7, ScholarAI?) - Product
2. Accuracy KPI definition methodology - Data Science
3. Neo4j prod capacity for anticipated 10Ã— vector index growth - Ops

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All unit, integration, and load tests green in CI/CD
- [ ] â‰¥95% correctly attributed research findings in staging KG
- [ ] 0 production incidents attributable to new agent during first 30 days
- [ ] Formal sign-off from Product, Architecture, Security, and Operations committees

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a **comprehensive, phased approach** to integrate advanced research capabilities while preserving existing functionality. The **14-week timeline** with **129 story points** ensures thorough implementation with proper testing and validation at each stage.

The **feature flag approach** enables zero-downtime deployment and instant rollback capability, while the **modular architecture** ensures maintainability and extensibility for future enhancements.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Phase 1 immediately to begin the discovery and gap analysis process.
