# ACCF Research Agent - MVP Implementation Prompt

## ðŸš€ ACCF Research Agent â€“ MVP Cleanup & Restructuring

### **Session Context**
- **Project**: ACCF Research Agent (Python 3.11, Neo4j GraphRAG, FastAPI, MCP)
- **Goal**: Transform from prototype to production-ready MVP in 4 weeks
- **Focus**: High-impact, low-effort improvements for production readiness

### **Current State Analysis**
- Multi-agent system with 15+ specialized agents
- Neo4j GraphRAG integration with vector search capabilities
- FastAPI async backend with Docker containerization
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration
- **Critical Issues**: Large files (consult_agent.py 51KB), scattered configs, hard-coded secrets, missing quality gates

### **MVP Objectives**
1. **O1**: Remove Critical technical-debt hotspots (`consult_agent.py` â‰¤ 400 LOC)
2. **O2**: Eliminate hard-coded secrets & CVEs (0 secrets in repo, 0 Critical/High CVEs)
3. **O3**: Guarantee baseline performance (P95 latency â‰¤ 250 ms @ 250 RPS)
4. **O4**: Establish automated SDLC quality gates (CI â‰¤ 8 min, Ruff/MyPy/pytest-asyncio/mutmut/CodeQL/Safety)
5. **O5**: Enable clear, minimal documentation (Getting Started & Architecture pages)

### **Implementation Plan**

#### **Phase 0: Kick-off & Baseline (Â½ week)**
1. **Clone repo & create `mvp-cleanup` branch**
2. **Repository Hygiene**:
   - Add comprehensive `.gitignore` rules for Python, logs, secrets
   - Purge `*.log` files using BFG Repo-Cleaner
   - Remove duplicate workspace configurations
3. **Baseline Assessment**:
   - Capture current performance metrics (k6 baseline)
   - Security scan baseline (CodeQL, Safety, Trivy)
   - Code quality baseline (Ruff, MyPy, coverage)
4. **Freeze feature development** - focus only on cleanup/restructuring

#### **Phase 1: Core Refactor (1 week)**
1. **Split `consult_agent.py` (51KB, 1008 lines)**:
   - Create `accf_agents/core/orchestrator.py` (async class)
   - Implement `AgentBase` ABC in `accf_agents/agents/__init__.py`
   - Extract shared utilities to `accf_agents/core/utils.py`
   - Registry auto-discovers agents via entry points
2. **Code Quality Setup**:
   - Add Ruff & Black pre-commit hooks
   - Configure MyPy with strict settings
   - Set up pytest-asyncio for async testing
3. **Remove dead/duplicate code**:
   - Consolidate knowledge update files
   - Remove unused imports and functions
   - Clean up duplicate configurations

#### **Phase 2: Security & Config Hardening (1 week)**
1. **Configuration Management**:
   - Implement Pydantic Settings with environment validation
   - Create `.env.sample` with all required variables
   - Remove hard-coded credentials from code
2. **Secrets Management**:
   - Integrate AWS Secrets Manager for production secrets
   - Local dev uses `.env`; prod fetches secrets via task role
   - Add GitLeaks pre-commit hook
3. **Security Scanning**:
   - Enable CodeQL in GitHub Actions
   - Add Safety for dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Integrate Trivy for container image scanning
   - Configure Dependabot for automated updates

#### **Phase 3: Testing & Performance (1 week)**
1. **Async Testing**:
   - Write pytest-asyncio tests for top 3 API endpoints
   - Add integration tests for Neo4j operations
   - Configure test coverage reporting (target â‰¥60%)
2. **Mutation Testing**:
   - Initialize mutmut baseline (target â‰¥60%)
   - Configure mutation testing in CI pipeline
   - Set quality gates for mutation score drops
3. **Neo4j Optimization**:
   - Switch to Neo4j vector similarity search (GraphRAG best practice)
   - Create vector indexes for embeddings
   - Optimize Cypher queries for performance
   - Add connection pooling and async driver usage
4. **Performance Validation**:
   - Run k6 smoke tests
   - Ensure P95 latency â‰¤ 250 ms @ 250 RPS
   - Monitor memory usage and optimize

#### **Phase 4: Documentation & Release (Â½ week)**
1. **Documentation Setup**:
   - Bootstrap MkDocs with Material theme
   - Create "Getting Started" guide
   - Document architecture overview
   - Publish to GitHub Pages
2. **Release Process**:
   - Tag `v0.5.0` using semantic-release
   - Monitor blue/green deployment
   - Validate all objectives met
   - Create release notes

### **Quality Gates (All Must Pass)**
- **Style/Lint**: Ruff (0 errors)
- **Formatting**: Black check (0 changes)
- **Typing**: MyPy (0 errors)
- **Unit + Async**: pytest-asyncio (coverage â‰¥60%)
- **Mutation**: mutmut (Î” coverage â‰¤2pp)
- **Security**: CodeQL, Safety, Trivy (0 Critical/High)
- **Secrets**: GitLeaks (0 secrets)

### **Technical Implementation Details**

#### **Refactor Pattern**
```python
# accf_agents/core/orchestrator.py
class AgentOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self, settings: Settings):
        self.settings = settings
        self.agents = self._discover_agents()

    async def execute_workflow(self, task: Task) -> Result:
        # Async workflow execution
        pass
```

#### **Configuration Management**
```python
# accf_agents/core/settings.py
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    neo4j_uri: str
    neo4j_user: str
    neo4j_password: str
    openai_api_key: str

    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"
```

#### **Neo4j Vector Search**
```cypher
-- Create vector index
CALL db.index.vector.createNodeIndex(
    'embeddings', 'Text', 'embedding', 1536, 'cosine'
);

-- Vector similarity search
MATCH (t:Text) WHERE id(t) = $id
CALL db.index.vector.queryNodes('embeddings', 5, $embedding)
YIELD node, score
RETURN node.text, score
```

#### **GitHub Actions Workflow**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with: {python-version: '3.11'}
      - name: Install deps
        run: |
          pip install poetry
          poetry install
      - name: Lint & Type
        run: poetry run ruff . && poetry run mypy .
      - name: Test
        run: poetry run pytest -q --asyncio-mode=auto --cov=accf_agents
      - name: Mutate
        run: poetry run mutmut run --paths-to-mutate accf_agents
      - name: Security
        uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3
      - name: Build Image
        run: docker build -t accf/agent:pr-${{github.sha}} .
```

### **Success Criteria**
- âœ… All 5 objectives (O1-O5) completed
- âœ… Quality gates passing consistently
- âœ… Performance targets met
- âœ… Security vulnerabilities eliminated
- âœ… Production deployment successful

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Incremental PRs**: Small, focused changes to avoid regressions
- **Smoke Tests**: 3 automated tests after each commit
- **Rollback Plan**: Automatic rollback on performance regression
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch alarms for P95 latency

### **Next Steps**
1. Execute Phase 0 immediately
2. Create Jira board "ACCF-MVP" with swim-lanes per phase
3. Daily 10-min stand-ups
4. Weekly demo/review sessions
5. Close MVP when all objectives met
