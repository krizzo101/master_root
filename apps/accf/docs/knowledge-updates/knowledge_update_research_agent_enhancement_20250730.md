# Knowledge Update: Research Agent Enhancement (Generated 2025-07-30)

## Current State (Last 12+ Months)

### OpenAI API Developments
- **Responses API**: New structured output API replacing chat completions for complex responses
- **Model Updates**: o4-mini, gpt-4.1-mini are current approved models (gpt-4o is forbidden)
- **Async Support**: Enhanced async capabilities with proper error handling
- **Structured Outputs**: Pydantic schema validation for all LLM responses
- **Security**: Mandatory input/output sanitization and PII removal

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Evolution
- **Multi-Server Support**: Concurrent connection to multiple MCP servers
- **Async Orchestration**: Parallel tool execution with proper error handling
- **Tool Integration**: Standardized approach for external research tools
- **Session Management**: Persistent context across multiple tool calls
- **Error Recovery**: Circuit breakers and fallback mechanisms

### Research Agent Patterns
- **Multi-Source Gathering**: Parallel execution of multiple research tools
- **Query Transformation**: Intelligent optimization for different tools
- **Synthesis**: Multi-source result combination and validation
- **Quality Assurance**: Reliability scoring and gap analysis
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Structured research processes

## Best Practices & Patterns

### OpenAI API Integration
- **Use Responses API**: Prefer structured outputs over chat completions
- **Model Compliance**: Only use o4-mini, gpt-4.1-mini (avoid gpt-4o)
- **Error Handling**: No silent fallbacks - explicit error handling required
- **Security**: Sanitize all inputs and outputs
- **Async Patterns**: Use async/await for all API calls

### MCP Tool Integration
- **Parallel Execution**: Use asyncio.gather for concurrent tool calls
- **Error Isolation**: Handle individual tool failures gracefully
- **Query Optimization**: Transform queries for specific tools
- **Result Standardization**: Normalize outputs across different tools
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascading failures

### Research Workflow Design
- **Multi-Phase Process**: Assessment → Research → Synthesis → Validation
- **Quality Gates**: Validate results at each phase
- **Source Attribution**: Track and cite information sources
- **Reliability Scoring**: Assess result quality and confidence
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing information and contradictions

## Tools & Frameworks

### External Research Tools
- **Brave Search**: Web search with privacy focus
- **Firecrawl**: Web scraping and content extraction
- **ArXiv**: Academic paper research
- **Context7**: Technical documentation search
- **MCP Integration**: Standardized tool access via MCP protocol

### Development Tools
- **Python 3.11+**: Required for async features
- **Poetry**: Dependency management
- **Pydantic**: Schema validation for structured outputs
- **asyncio**: Async/await for concurrent operations
- **Logging**: Comprehensive research process logging

### Quality Assurance
- **Reliability Scoring**: Assess result confidence
- **Cross-Source Validation**: Compare results across sources
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing information
- **Contradiction Detection**: Flag conflicting information
- **Source Quality Assessment**: Evaluate source credibility

## Implementation Guidance

### Phase 1: External Research Tools
1. **Extract MCP Clients**: Copy working implementations from reference
2. **Integrate with Current Agent**: Add to existing research agent
3. **Maintain API Compatibility**: Keep existing methods working
4. **Add Error Handling**: Implement proper fallbacks
5. **Test Integration**: Validate with existing workflows

### Phase 2: Async Orchestration
