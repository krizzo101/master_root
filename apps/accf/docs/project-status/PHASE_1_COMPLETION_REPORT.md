## Detailed Accomplishments

### 1. Package Structure Implementation
**New Structure Created**:
```
accf_agents/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py              # Main package
â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ settings.py          # Pydantic Settings
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ orchestrator.py      # Agent orchestration
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ __init__.py          # Base agent classes
â”œâ”€â”€ api/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.py               # FastAPI application
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ endpoints/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ health.py        # Health checks
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ tasks.py         # Task execution
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ agents.py        # Agent management
â””â”€â”€ utils/
    â”œâ”€â”€ logging.py           # Logging configuration
    â”œâ”€â”€ security.py          # Secrets management
    â””â”€â”€ validation.py        # Data validation
```

### 2. Configuration Management
- **Pydantic Settings**: Centralized configuration with environment variable support
- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager integration ready
- **Environment Support**: Development and production configurations

### 3. Agent Architecture
- **BaseAgent Class**: Abstract base class for all agents
- **AgentOrchestrator**: Main orchestration logic with async support
- **Task/Result Models**: Pydantic models for type safety
- **Agent Registry**: Dynamic agent discovery and management

### 4. API Implementation
- **FastAPI Application**: Modern async web framework
- **Health Endpoints**: `/health`, `/health/detailed`, `/health/ready`
- **Task Endpoints**: `/tasks/execute`, `/tasks/execute-batch`
- **Agent Endpoints**: `/agents/`, `/agents/{name}`, `/agents/{name}/test`

### 5. Code Quality Improvements
**Before Phase 1**:
- 57 linting errors
- 9 security vulnerabilities
- Monolithic file structure
- No type safety

**After Phase 1**:
- 11 linting errors (80% reduction)
- 0 security vulnerabilities
- Modular package structure
