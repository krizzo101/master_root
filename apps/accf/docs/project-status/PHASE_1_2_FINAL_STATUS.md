- **Achievements**:
  - Created comprehensive performance testing framework (`performance_test.py`)
  - Implemented P95 latency measurement (target: ‚â§ 250ms)
  - Added concurrent request testing with semaphore control
  - Created `k6_performance_test.js` for advanced load testing
  - Performance metrics tracking and reporting implemented
  - **Note**: Actual performance baseline testing requires running server

### ‚úÖ **O4: Establish Automated SDLC Quality Gates**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Full CI/CD pipeline implemented
- **Achievements**:
  - Created comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
  - Multi-Python version testing (3.11, 3.12)
  - Automated quality gates: linting, type checking, tests, security scanning
  - Security scanning: Safety, CodeQL, Trivy
  - Performance testing integration
  - Docker build pipeline

## Technical Achievements
