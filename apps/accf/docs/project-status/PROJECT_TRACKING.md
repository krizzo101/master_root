# ACCF Research Agent - MVP Cleanup Project

## Process & QA Workstream

### Objectives Status

#### Core Objectives (O1-O4)
- [ ] O1: Remove Critical technical-debt hotspots
- [ ] O2: Eliminate hard-coded secrets & CVEs
- [ ] O3: Guarantee baseline performance
- [ ] O4: Establish automated SDLC quality gates

#### Process & QA Objectives (O5-O8)
- [ ] O5: Enable clear, minimal documentation (Getting Started & Architecture pages)
- [ ] O6: Establish automated SDLC quality gates (CI ≤ 8 min, comprehensive tooling)
- [ ] O7: Implement monitoring and observability
- [ ] O8: Create release management and deployment processes

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 0: Process Foundation (½ week) - ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create project tracking document
- [x] Create process documentation structure
- [x] Initialize baseline process assessment
- [x] Set up project governance

#### Phase 1: CI/CD & Quality Gates (1 week) - ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Enhance existing CI workflow
- [x] Add quality gate configuration
- [x] Implement mutation testing
- [x] Add security scanning enhancements

#### Phase 2: Documentation & Knowledge Management (1 week) - ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Set up MkDocs structure
- [x] Create Getting Started guide
- [x] Document architecture
- [x] Create API reference

#### Phase 3: Monitoring & Observability (1 week) - ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement CloudWatch metrics
- [x] Add health check endpoints
- [x] Set up logging infrastructure
- [x] Create monitoring dashboards

#### Phase 4: Release Management (½ week) - ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement semantic release
- [x] Create release notes template
- [x] Set up automated deployment
- [x] Establish rollback procedures

### Success Criteria
- ✅ All 4 process objectives (O5-O8) completed
- ✅ Documentation published and accessible
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline automated and reliable (≤8 min)
- ✅ Monitoring and observability implemented
- ✅ Release process automated and repeatable

### Governance & Communication
- **Daily Stand-ups**: 10-minute Slack updates
- **Weekly Reviews**: 30-minute Zoom demos
- **Quality Gates**: All must pass before merge
- **Release Process**: Automated with manual approval for major versions

### Current Status
**Started**: Process & QA Implementation
**Phase**: All Phases Completed ✅
**Status**: Process & QA Workstream Successfully Implemented

### Objectives Status Summary
- ✅ O5: Enable clear, minimal documentation (Getting Started & Architecture pages)
- ✅ O6: Establish automated SDLC quality gates (CI ≤ 8 min, comprehensive tooling)
- ✅ O7: Implement monitoring and observability
- ✅ O8: Create release management and deployment processes

### Implementation Summary
All 4 Process & QA objectives (O5-O8) have been successfully completed:

1. **Documentation**: Complete MkDocs structure with comprehensive guides
2. **CI/CD**: Enhanced pipeline with quality gates, mutation testing, and security scanning
3. **Monitoring**: CloudWatch integration with health checks and metrics collection
4. **Release Management**: Automated semantic versioning with deployment and rollback procedures

The ACCF Research Agent now has a production-ready process and quality assurance foundation.
