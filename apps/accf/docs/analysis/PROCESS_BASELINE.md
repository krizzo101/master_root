# Process Baseline Assessment

## Current State Analysis

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Status**: ✅ Basic GitHub Actions workflow exists
- **Components**:
  - Python 3.11 setup with caching
  - Neo4j service integration
  - Linting (ruff, black, mypy)
  - Test coverage with pytest
  - Security scanning (Snyk, TruffleHog)
  - Docker build and push
- **Issues**:
  - No quality gates enforcement
  - Missing mutation testing
  - No performance benchmarks
  - Limited security coverage

### Documentation
- **Status**: ⚠️ Scattered markdown files
- **Existing**: README.md, DESIGN_DOC.md, PROD_CHECKLIST.md
- **Issues**:
  - No structured documentation site
  - Missing API reference
  - No user guides
  - Inconsistent formatting

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Status**: ❌ None implemented
- **Missing**:
  - Health check endpoints
  - Metrics collection
  - Logging infrastructure
  - Performance monitoring
  - Alerting system

### Release Process
- **Status**: ⚠️ Manual process
- **Current**: Docker image builds on main branch
- **Issues**:
  - No semantic versioning
  - No automated release notes
  - No rollback procedures
  - No deployment automation

## Target State Definition

### CI/CD Pipeline (Target)
- **Quality Gates**: Enforced with thresholds
- **Performance**: ≤8 minute total runtime
- **Coverage**: ≥60% test coverage
- **Mutation Testing**: ≥60% mutation score
- **Security**: Comprehensive vulnerability scanning
- **Automation**: Full pipeline automation

### Documentation (Target)
- **Structure**: MkDocs with Material theme
- **Content**:
  - Getting Started guide
  - Architecture documentation
  - API reference
  - Admin guides
- **Quality**: All links valid, searchable, versioned

### Monitoring & Observability (Target)
- **Metrics**: CloudWatch integration
- **Health Checks**: /health endpoint
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logging
- **Alerts**: Automated alerting
- **Dashboards**: Performance monitoring

### Release Process (Target)
- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning automated
- **Notes**: Automated release notes generation
- **Deployment**: Blue/green deployment
- **Rollback**: Automated rollback procedures
- **Governance**: Manual approval for major versions

## Gap Analysis

### High Priority Gaps
1. **Quality Gates**: Missing enforcement mechanisms
2. **Documentation Structure**: No organized documentation site
3. **Monitoring**: No observability infrastructure
4. **Release Automation**: Manual process needs automation

### Medium Priority Gaps
1. **Mutation Testing**: Missing test quality validation
2. **Performance Monitoring**: No baseline metrics
3. **Security Enhancement**: Limited vulnerability coverage

### Low Priority Gaps
1. **Advanced CI Features**: Can be added incrementally
2. **Custom Dashboards**: Can be built after basic monitoring

## Implementation Priority
