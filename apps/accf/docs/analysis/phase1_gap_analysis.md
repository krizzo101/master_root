# Phase 1 – Discovery & Gap Analysis Report
_Date: 2025-07-30_
_Authors: Lead Backend Engineer_

## 1. Executive Summary

The ACCF project has a **sophisticated but fragmented research implementation** with critical compliance violations. The current production research agent (54 LOC) is basic compared to the advanced reference implementation (6,547 LOC total). Key findings: 3 compliance violations (forbidden gpt-4o usage), 7 major functional gaps, and 5 architectural deltas requiring immediate attention. The Neo4j knowledge graph integration is production-ready, but the research workflow lacks MCP orchestration and advanced synthesis capabilities.

## 2. Current Production State

### 2.1 Code Overview
- **File**: `capabilities/research_agent.py` (53 LOC)
- **Architecture**: Simple synchronous LLM-based research
- **Dependencies**: `shared.openai_interfaces.responses_interface`
- **API**: `answer_question()`, `answer_question_using_llm()`

### 2.2 Functionality
- Basic canned answer logic with fallback to LLM
- Simple JSON response format
- No MCP tool orchestration
- No multi-source research capabilities
- No synthesis or quality assurance
- No workflow orchestration
- Neo4j persistence handled separately by `KnowledgeAgent`

### 2.3 Supporting Components
- **Knowledge Agent**: `capabilities/knowledge_agent.py` (239 LOC) - Full GraphRAG integration
- **Neo4j Graph**: `capabilities/neo4j_knowledge_graph.py` (412 LOC) - Vector search capabilities
- **MCP Integration**: `mcp_agent_server.py` - Basic MCP server setup

## 3. Reference Implementation State

### 3.1 Code Overview
- **Root**: `.reference/research_team/` (6,547 LOC total)
- **Architecture**: Advanced async MCP orchestration with 11-stage workflow
- **Components**: 47 files across 7 directories

### 3.2 Functionality
- **Research Agent**: Async MCP tool orchestration (Brave Search, Firecrawl, ArXiv, Context7)
- **Workflow**: 11-stage LangGraph workflow with QA gates
- **Tools**: Multiple MCP wrappers for external research
- **Synthesis**: Advanced synthesis agent with source attribution
- **Quality Assurance**: Cross-source validation and reliability scoring
- **Persistence**: Graph write-back with relationship mapping
- **Logging**: Comprehensive research logging system

### 3.3 Advanced Features
- **Query Transformation**: Intelligent query optimization for each tool
- **Parallel Execution**: Async gathering from multiple sources
- **Error Handling**: Circuit breakers and fallback mechanisms
- **Session Reporting**: Detailed research session analytics
- **Multi-source Synthesis**: Cross-validation and gap analysis

## 7. Findings & Recommendations

### 7.1 Critical Findings
1. **Compliance Violations**: 3 instances of forbidden gpt-4o usage require immediate remediation
2. **Functional Gap**: Current implementation lacks 90% of advanced research capabilities
3. **Architectural Mismatch**: Sync vs async execution patterns incompatible
4. **Integration Complexity**: Reference implementation 123x larger than production

### 7.2 Recommendations
1. **Immediate**: Replace all gpt-4o references with approved models (o4-mini, gpt-4.1-mini)
2. **Phase 2**: Implement adapter pattern for gradual migration
3. **Phase 3**: Migrate to async MCP orchestration
4. **Phase 4**: Integrate advanced synthesis and QA capabilities
5. **Phase 5**: Implement comprehensive logging and reporting

### 7.3 Migration Strategy
- **Feature Flag Approach**: Use `IResearchEngine` interface for zero-downtime deployment
- **Adapter Pattern**: Bridge current sync implementation with async reference
- **Incremental Rollout**: Migrate capabilities one at a time
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive integration testing at each phase
