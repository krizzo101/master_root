# Quick Start Guide

Get the ACCF Research Agent up and running in **5 minutes** with this step-by-step guide.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** installed
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized deployment)
- **Git** for cloning the repository
- **Neo4j Database** (local or cloud instance)

## üöÄ Step 1: Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/accf/research-agent.git
cd accf-research-agent

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Configuration

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit configuration (see Configuration Guide for details)
nano .env
```

**Required Environment Variables:**

```env
# Neo4j Database
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-password
NEO4J_DATABASE=neo4j

# OpenAI API (for agent reasoning)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# Application Settings
APP_ENV=development
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Step 3: Database Setup

### Option A: Local Neo4j (Docker)

```bash
# Start Neo4j with Docker
docker run \
  --name neo4j \
  -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 \
  -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/your-password \
  -e NEO4J_PLUGINS='["apoc", "graph-data-science"]' \
  neo4j:5.15

# Verify connection
curl http://localhost:7474
```

### Option B: Neo4j AuraDB (Cloud)

1. Create account at [Neo4j AuraDB](https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-database/)
2. Create new database instance
3. Copy connection details to `.env` file

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Step 4: Start the Application

```bash
# Start the FastAPI server
python -m uvicorn agent_api:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Verify Installation:**

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# API documentation
open http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## üß™ Step 5: Your First Research Query

### Using the API

```bash
# Simple research query
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/research" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?",
    "max_results": 5,
    "include_sources": true
  }'
```

### Using Python Client

```python
import requests

# Research query
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/research",
    json={
        "query": "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?",
        "max_results": 5,
        "include_sources": True
    }
)

# Print results
results = response.json()
print(f"Research completed in {results['duration']} seconds")
print(f"Found {len(results['sources'])} sources")
print(f"Summary: {results['summary']}")
```

### Using the Web Interface

1. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser
2. Enter your research query
3. Click "Start Research"
4. Monitor progress in real-time
5. Review results and sources

## üìä Step 6: Monitor and Explore

### View Research History

```bash
# Get recent research sessions
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/research/history
```

### Check Agent Status

```bash
# View agent health and performance
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/agents/status
```

### Explore Knowledge Graph

```bash
# Query the knowledge graph
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/knowledge/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "cypher": "MATCH (n) RETURN n LIMIT 10"
  }'
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue                       | Solution                                                             |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Neo4j Connection Failed** | Check credentials and network connectivity                           |
| **OpenAI API Error**        | Verify API key and billing status                                    |
| **Port Already in Use**     | Change port: `uvicorn agent_api:app --port 8001`                     |
| **Import Errors**           | Ensure all dependencies installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt` |

### Logs and Debugging

```bash
# Enable debug logging
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
python -m uvicorn agent_api:app --reload

# View application logs
tail -f logs/app.log
```
