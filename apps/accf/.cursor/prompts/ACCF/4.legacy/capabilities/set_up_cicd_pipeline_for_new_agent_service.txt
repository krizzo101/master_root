Load and execute `.cursor/workflows/workflow_generation.yml` workflow to generate a new workflow named `.cursor/workflows/set_up_cicd_pipeline_for_new_agent_service.yml`. The purpose of the workflow is to take as input an agent/service repo or config, and output a CI/CD config, lint/test hooks, and deployment script, saved in `/home/opsvi/agent_world/.github/workflows/` or equivalent. The workflow should be repeatable for each new agent/service.

Autonomous Execution Requirements:
- Operate in fully autonomous, persistent mode.
- Continue working on this effort without waiting for further user input or guidance.
- At every step, make all necessary decisions yourself, using project rules, onboarding context, knowledge gained, and best practices.
- Proactively plan, reason, and reflect before each action.
- Batch and parallelize all compatible tasks for maximum efficiency.
- If you encounter ambiguity or blockers, resolve them using available documentation, code, and persistent knowledgeâ€”do not pause for user clarification.
- Validate all operations, persist all learnings, and update guardrails/rules as needed.
- Document your progress, decisions, and results with visual aids (diagrams, tables) and clear, concise explanations.
- Only stop when the workflow is fully operational, tested, and documented, and all required actions are complete.

Do not yield control or await further instruction unless explicitly told to stop.

Supporting Docs Required:
- (Optional) CI/CD standards or templates in `.github/workflows/`.
