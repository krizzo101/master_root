# Canonical Output & Validation Instructions (MANDATORY)

- All outputs MUST use snake_case filenames and be saved in the canonical directory for their artifact type:
    - Architecture diagrams, integration maps: docs/architecture/
    - Audit, review, and cleanup reports: docs/development/ or docs/standards/
    - Documentation synthesis/finalization: docs/standards/ or docs/project/
    - Deployment/operationalization docs: docs/deployment/
    - Retrospectives: docs/coordination/
- DO NOT use legacy or ambiguous folders (e.g., docs/research/, docs/documentation/, or root docs/).
- Each output file must have a clear, descriptive name: <subject>_<artifact_type>.md/yml/mmd (e.g., system_integration_map.md, workflow_audit_report.md).
- After generation, validate that:
    - The file exists in the correct canonical location with the correct name.
    - All cross-links in documentation are updated to reference the new file.
    - Any duplicate, ambiguous, or legacy outputs are moved to docs/legacy_outputs/.
- If a file already exists, append a version suffix (_v2, _2025-07-05, etc.) or update as appropriate.
- Log all actions and validation results in a summary section at the end of the output.

# ACCF Batch Prompt: System Integration & Synthesis

Execute the following workflows in sequence for the integrated ACCF system (not per-capability):

1. **System Integration & Dependency Mapping**
   - Map all integration points between agentic capabilities
   - Document dependencies and data flows
   - Validate with architecture diagrams and dependency maps

2. **Architecture/Behavior Synthesis**
   - Synthesize a comprehensive architecture summary
   - Document system-wide behavior and configuration patterns
   - Ensure all cross-capability interactions are covered

3. **Change Impact Assessment**
   - Analyze modification boundaries and change impacts
   - Document affected components and integration risks

**Instructions:**
- Leverage all previously generated artifacts and diagrams
- Save outputs in `docs/architecture/` and `docs/development/`
- Validate for completeness, cross-linking, and actionable clarity
