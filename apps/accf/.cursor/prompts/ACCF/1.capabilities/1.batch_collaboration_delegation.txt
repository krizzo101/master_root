Load and execute the following workflows in fully autonomous, persistent, and batched mode for the Collaboration & Delegation capability (see `docs/applications/ACCF/standards/what_an_agent_needs_to_excel_collaboration_delegation.md`):

1. `.cursor/workflows/create_update_adr.yml`
2. `.cursor/workflows/define_agent_api_protocol_specification.yml`
3. `.cursor/workflows/generate_test_plan_for_capability.yml`
4. `.cursor/workflows/decompose_capability_into_implementation_tasks.yml`
5. `.cursor/workflows/automate_documentation_update_for_new_capability.yml`
6. `.cursor/workflows/peer_review_of_agentic_artifact.yml`
7. `.cursor/workflows/conduct_agent_led_retrospective.yml`

**Batch Execution Requirements:**
- For each workflow, use the correct input file and context.
- Validate and document all outputs before proceeding to the next workflow.
- Commit all changes to git with clear messages after each workflow or at the end of the batch.
- Continue until all outputs are generated, validated, and documented.
- Maximize efficiency by batching compatible steps, but do not sacrifice quality or standards compliance.
