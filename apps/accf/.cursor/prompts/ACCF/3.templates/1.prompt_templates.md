**Action/Reasoning/Output:**

---

### 1. **Approach**

- For each proposed workflow, generate a prompt (following the structure and requirements of your attached prompt template) that instructs an agent to generate the workflow.
- Each prompt will specify:
  - The workflow to generate (purpose, inputs, outputs, repeatability).
  - The output template or supporting docs to use (if any).
  - The output location for the workflow file.
  - Autonomous execution requirements (as in your template).
- If any supporting docs/templates are required but not yet present, I will flag them.

---

### 2. **Prompt Template Reference**

Your attached prompt is clear and robust. I will adapt it for each workflow, specifying:
- The workflow YAML to generate (name, location).
- The output template (if any).
- The context/supporting docs to reference.
- The use case/focus for the workflow.
- The autonomous execution requirements.

---

### 3. **Workflow Prompts**

#### **A. Synthesize and Prioritize Agentic Requirements**

**Prompt:**
```
Load and execute `.cursor/workflows/workflow_generation.yml` workflow to generate a new workflow named `.cursor/workflows/synthesize_and_prioritize_agentic_requirements.yml`. The purpose of the workflow is to take as input a set of completed agent needs templates (e.g., all files in `/home/opsvi/agent_world/docs/applications/ACCF/research/` matching `what_an_agent_needs_to_excel__*.md`), and output a prioritized list of agentic capabilities, a dependency map (visual and tabular), and a gap analysis. The workflow should be repeatable for any new set of requirements or after major updates.

Autonomous Execution Requirements:
- Operate in fully autonomous, persistent mode.
- Continue working on this effort without waiting for further user input or guidance.
- At every step, make all necessary decisions yourself, using project rules, onboarding context, knowledge gained, and best practices.
- Proactively plan, reason, and reflect before each action.
- Batch and parallelize all compatible tasks for maximum efficiency.
- If you encounter ambiguity or blockers, resolve them using available documentation, code, and persistent knowledge—do not pause for user clarification.
- Validate all operations, persist all learnings, and update guardrails/rules as needed.
- Document your progress, decisions, and results with visual aids (diagrams, tables) and clear, concise explanations.
- Only stop when the workflow is fully operational, tested, and documented, and all required actions are complete.

Do not yield control or await further instruction unless explicitly told to stop.
```
**Supporting Docs Required:**
- All agent needs templates in `/docs/research/` (should already exist).

The workflow should be repeatable for each capability or system module.

Autonomous Execution Requirements:
- Operate in fully autonomous, persistent mode.

The purpose of the workflow is to take as input a design decision context (e.g., communication protocol, storage choice, etc.), and output an ADR in standard format, saved in `/home/opsvi/agent_world/docs/architecture/adr/`. The workflow should be repeatable for every major design decision.

Autonomous Execution Requirements:

---

### 4. **Supporting Infrastructure/Docs Checklist**

- **Agent needs templates**: `/docs/research/` (should exist)
- **Diagram style guide**: `/docs/architecture/` (optional, for visual consistency)
- **ADR template**: `/docs/architecture/adr/` (optional, for standardization)
- **API spec template**: `/docs/api/` (optional)
- **Test plan template**: `/docs/testing/` (optional)
- **Documentation standards/templates**: `/docs/` (optional)
- **CI/CD standards/templates**: `.github/workflows/` (optional)
- **Retrospective template**: `/docs/coordination/` (optional)
- **Review template**: `/docs/development/` (optional)

**If any of the optional templates are not present and you want strict standardization, create them before running the workflow generation. Otherwise, the agent can proceed and generate its own structure.**

---

### 5. **How to Use**

- Copy each prompt into a file in `.cursor/prompts/AACF/` (e.g., `.cursor/prompts/ACCF/4.legacy/capabilities/generate_architecture_diagram_for_capability.txt`).
- Assign the prompt to the agent responsible for workflow generation.
- Ensure any required supporting docs/templates are in place for maximum quality and consistency.

---

**If you want, I can scaffold these prompt files for you, or help you create any missing templates before you begin. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!**
