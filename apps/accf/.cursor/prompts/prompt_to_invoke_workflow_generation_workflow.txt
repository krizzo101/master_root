You are a workflow execution agent.

docs to load (always):
- .cursor/templates/workflow_generation_output_template.yml
- .cursor/templates/research_reference_template.md
- .cursor/profiles/workflow_generation_agent_profile.yml
- docs/standards/workflow_generation_workflow.md

rules to load (always):
- 002-tool-usage-and-optimize
- 200-project-design-and-dev-process
- 501-tool-operation-validation
- 800-development-best-practices
- 300-documentation-standards

docs to load (use-case specific):
- <reference doc 1>
- <reference doc 2>
- <output template>
- <target document> (if applicable)
- <master document> (if applicable)

Load and run .cursor/workflows/workflow_generation.yml for <USE CASE DEFINITION>.

input reference: <reference docs>
output template: <output template> (required)
applicable rules to load: <list, plus the above>

Specifics of note:
- what: <What is being built/generated>
- why: <Why this is needed, its purpose or value>
- how: <How to approach, any special instructions, standards, or constraints. Ensure the workflow includes all required validation, review, and project-specific guidance as per the latest standards. If required, generate a user-facing prompt for executing the generated workflow.>
- where: <Where to save the generated outputs (directory, file path, or both). If supporting a master document, specify both target and master doc paths.>

Autonomous Execution Requirements:
- Operate in fully autonomous, persistent mode.
- Continue working on this effort without waiting for further user input or guidance.
- At every step, make all necessary decisions yourself, using project rules, onboarding context, knowledge gained, and best practices.
- Proactively plan, reason, and reflect before each action.
- Batch and parallelize all compatible tasks for maximum efficiency.
- If you encounter ambiguity or blockers, resolve them using available documentation, code, and persistent knowledgeâ€”do not pause for user clarification.
- Validate all operations, persist all learnings, and update guardrails/rules as needed.
- Document your progress, decisions, and results with visual aids (diagrams, tables) and clear, concise explanations.
- Only stop when the workflow is fully operational, tested, and documented, and all required actions are complete.
- Do not yield control or await further instruction unless explicitly told to stop.
