# AGENT-IDE DATABASE COMPATIBILITY PROTOCOL

**TRIGGER**: Database operation development, workflow creation, tool integration
**PURPOSE**: Ensure all database operations use Agent-IDE compatible patterns

## DETECT PATTERNS
- Database operation definitions (search, modify, manage)
- Workflow files with mcp_cognitive_tools_arango operations
- Protocol files with database examples
- Any references to deprecated cognitive schema patterns

## VERIFY & CORRECT
1. **Search Type Validation**: IF database search ‚Üí VERIFY search_type ‚àà [content, type, tags, date_range, id, recent] ‚Üí IF NOT replace with compatible type
2. **Parameter Compatibility**: IF search operation ‚Üí VERIFY no [document_type, min_quality, quality_field] parameters ‚Üí IF NOT remove/convert parameters
3. **Collection Validation**: IF database operation ‚Üí VERIFY collection ‚àà [research_docs, heuristics, metrics, rules, modules, tasks, branches, ide_state, user_prefs] ‚Üí IF NOT update to Agent-IDE collections
4. **Tool Reference Check**: IF tool usage ‚Üí VERIFY uses mcp_cognitive_tools_arango_* ‚Üí IF NOT update from mcp_multi_modal_db_*

## EXECUTION FLOW
```
[OPERATION_DETECT] ‚Üí [COMPATIBILITY_CHECK] ‚Üí [AUTO_CORRECT] ‚Üí [VALIDATION_TEST]
```

## AGENT-IDE COMPATIBILITY MATRIX

### ‚úÖ SUPPORTED OPERATIONS
```yaml
Search Types: [content, type, tags, date_range, id, recent]
Collections: [research_docs, heuristics, metrics, rules, modules, tasks, branches, ide_state, user_prefs]
Operations: [insert, update, delete, upsert]
Tools: [mcp_cognitive_tools_arango_search, mcp_cognitive_tools_arango_modify, mcp_cognitive_tools_arango_manage]
```

### ‚ùå UNSUPPORTED PATTERNS
```yaml
Search Types: [quality, related, semantic]
Parameters: [document_type, min_quality, quality_field, reference_id]
Collections: [cognitive_concepts, agent_memory, semantic_relationships, intelligence_analytics]
Tools: [mcp_multi_modal_db_*, old cognitive tools]
```

### üîÑ CONVERSION PATTERNS
```yaml
search_type: "quality" ‚Üí search_type: "content" + quality keywords
search_type: "related" ‚Üí search_type: "content" + relationship keywords
document_type: "X" ‚Üí content: "... X ..." (incorporate into content search)
min_quality: N ‚Üí Use content-based filtering with quality keywords
```

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- ‚úÖ All database operations use supported Agent-IDE patterns
- ‚úÖ No deprecated tool references in workflows or protocols
- ‚úÖ Search operations use only supported search_type values
- ‚úÖ Insert operations use content_type instead of document_type

## TESTING VALIDATION
```bash
# Runtime Test - Verify Agent-IDE startup compatibility
mcp_cognitive_tools_arango_manage --action health
mcp_cognitive_tools_arango_search --search_type content --collection research_docs --content "test" --limit 1
```

## TRACKING
```aql
INSERT {
  type: "compatibility_check",
  validation_target: @file_or_operation,
  compatibility_status: @pass_fail,
  issues_found: @issue_list,
  corrections_applied: @correction_list,
  timestamp: DATE_NOW()
} INTO metrics
```

## INTEGRATES WITH
- **Rule 600-graph-database-interaction**: Database operation standards
- **Protocol database-operation**: Core database usage patterns
- **Workflow 00-startup**: Startup compatibility validation
- **Collection research_docs**: Documentation of compatibility requirements

This protocol ensures Agent-IDE database compatibility through proactive validation and automatic correction of deprecated patterns, preventing runtime failures and ensuring seamless agent operation.
