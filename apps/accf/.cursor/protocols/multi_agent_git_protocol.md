# MULTI-AGENT GIT PROTOCOL

## PURPOSE
Establish safe, coordinated version control practices for multiple autonomous agents operating simultaneously in the same repository.

## CRITICAL PRINCIPLES

### üö® SAFETY FIRST
- **NEVER commit automatically** without explicit verification
- **ALWAYS check git status** before any file modifications
- **NEVER commit changes made by other agents** without explicit coordination
- **ALWAYS backup before destructive operations**

### ü§ñ AGENT IDENTIFICATION
- Each agent session MUST have a unique identifier
- Format: `AGENT-{session-id}` or `AGENT-{user}-{timestamp}`
- All commits MUST include agent ID in message: `[AGENT-ID] action: description`

## BRANCH STRATEGY

### Option A: Agent-Specific Branches (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# Each agent works on own branch
agent-{id}-{task-name}
# Examples:
agent-session1-rule-updates
agent-alice-database-fixes
```

### Option B: Coordinated Main Branch
- Only when agents are working on completely separate files
- Requires strict file ownership tracking
- Higher risk - use with caution

## PRE-OPERATION PROTOCOLS

### 1. GIT STATUS CHECK (MANDATORY)
```bash
# Before ANY file modification
git status --porcelain
git diff --name-only
```

### 2. ANALYZE UNCOMMITTED CHANGES
If uncommitted changes exist:
- **Files I modified**: Commit with my agent ID
- **Files modified by others**:
  - DO NOT TOUCH without coordination
  - Document in session log
  - Consider stashing or separate handling

### 3. FILE OWNERSHIP TRACKING
Maintain session log of files modified:
```
SESSION: agent-{id}
MODIFIED FILES:
- file1.txt (created)
- file2.py (modified lines 10-25)
- file3.md (deleted)
```

## COMMIT PROTOCOLS

### 1. COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT
```
[AGENT-{ID}] {action}: {description}

Examples:
[AGENT-SESSION1] create: multi-agent git protocol
[AGENT-ALICE] fix: database connection timeout issue
[AGENT-BOB] update: documentation for new API endpoints
```

### 2. ATOMIC COMMITS
- One logical change per commit
- Complete, working state
- Include tests/validation when applicable

### 3. PRE-COMMIT VALIDATION
```bash
# Validate before committing
git diff --cached --stat
git diff --cached --name-only
# Review changes are only YOUR changes
```

## STARTUP BEHAVIOR REVISION

### ‚ùå OLD (DANGEROUS)
```
- Auto-commit before changes
- Auto-commit after changes
- No conflict checking
```

### ‚úÖ NEW (SAFE)
```
- Check git status and report
- Document any uncommitted changes
- Only commit if orphaned changes from previous sessions
- Focus on assessment, not modification
```

## CONFLICT RESOLUTION

### 1. DETECTION
```bash
git status
git diff
git log --oneline -10  # Check recent commits
```

### 2. RESOLUTION STRATEGY
- **PAUSE** all operations if conflicts detected
- **ANALYZE** what changes conflict and why
- **COORDINATE** with other agents if needed
- **DOCUMENT** resolution in commit message

### 3. NEVER AUTO-RESOLVE
- Always require explicit review
- Use interactive merge tools when needed
- Document decision-making process

## COORDINATION MECHANISMS

### 1. SESSION COORDINATION FILE
```yaml
# .agent-sessions.yml
active_sessions:
  - agent_id: "agent-session1"
    branch: "agent-session1-protocols"
    start_time: "2025-06-28T11:15:00Z"
    files_claimed: ["protocols/", "rules/"]
  - agent_id: "agent-alice"
    branch: "main"
    files_claimed: ["src/database/"]
```

### 2. COMMIT COMMUNICATION
Use commit messages to communicate:
```
[AGENT-A] note: modified shared config, agent-b please review
[AGENT-B] merge: integrated agent-a changes, tested successfully
```

## IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### 1. IMMEDIATE CHANGES
- [ ] Remove auto-commit from startup workflow
- [ ] Add git status check to all file operations
- [ ] Implement agent ID system
- [ ] Create session tracking mechanism

### 2. WORKFLOW UPDATES
- [ ] Update startup workflow to assessment-only
- [ ] Add git safety checks to file modification tools
- [ ] Implement pre-commit validation
- [ ] Add conflict detection

### 3. SAFETY MECHANISMS
- [ ] Dry-run mode for git operations
- [ ] Backup creation before major changes
- [ ] Session file ownership tracking
- [ ] Agent coordination logging

## EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### If Conflicts Occur
1. **STOP** all agent operations
2. **BACKUP** current state
3. **ANALYZE** conflicts manually
4. **COORDINATE** resolution strategy
5. **TEST** resolution before proceeding

### If Data Loss Suspected
1. **IMMEDIATELY** create backup branch
2. **USE** git reflog to find lost commits
3. **DOCUMENT** incident in session log
4. **IMPLEMENT** additional safeguards

## MONITORING AND VALIDATION

### Git Health Checks
```bash
# Regular validation
git fsck
git status
git log --oneline -20
git branch -v
```

### Session Audit
- Track which agent modified which files
- Monitor for unauthorized changes
- Validate commit attribution
- Check for orphaned changes

## EXAMPLES

### Safe Agent Startup
```bash
# 1. Check current state
git status
git log --oneline -5

# 2. Document findings
echo "Git clean, no conflicts detected" > session.log

# 3. Create agent branch if needed
git checkout -b agent-session1-task

# 4. Proceed with work
```

### Safe File Modification
```bash
# 1. Pre-check
git status file.txt
git diff file.txt

# 2. Modify file
# ... make changes ...

# 3. Validate and commit
git add file.txt
git diff --cached file.txt
git commit -m "[AGENT-SESSION1] update: improve file.txt functionality"
```

## ENFORCEMENT

This protocol is **MANDATORY** for all agent operations involving version control. Violations risk data loss and operational conflicts.

**ACTIVATION**: This protocol takes effect immediately and supersedes all previous git-related behavioral directives.
