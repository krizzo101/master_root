# MULTI-AGENT COORDINATION PROTOCOL
*Unified Git Safety + Change Management System*

## üéØ **PROTOCOL STATUS**
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Status**: ACTIVE
- **Implementation**: Phase 1 (Git Safety) + Phase 2 (Integration)
- **Last Updated**: 2025-06-28T07:45:00Z

---

## üÜî **AGENT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM**

### **Standard Format**:
```yaml
agent_id: "AGENT-{context}-{date}-{sequence}"

context_codes:
  STARTUP: "Initial system activation and assessment"
  TASK: "Specific assigned work completion"
  EMERGENCY: "Crisis response and conflict resolution"
  VALIDATION: "Testing and verification activities"
  HANDOFF: "Session transfer and coordination"

examples:
  - "AGENT-STARTUP-2025-06-28-001"
  - "AGENT-TASK-2025-06-28-002"
  - "AGENT-EMERGENCY-2025-06-28-003"
```

### **Usage Requirements**:
- **Git Commits**: `[{agent_id}] {action}: {description}`
- **Change Records**: `agent_id: {agent_id}`
- **Session Files**: `{agent_id}-session.log`
- **Database Entries**: `agent_id: {agent_id}`

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **MODULE A: GIT SAFETY**
*Owner: AGENT-STARTUP-2025-06-28*

### **MANDATORY PRE-OPERATION CHECKS**:
```bash
# Before ANY file modification
git status --porcelain
git diff --name-only
# Verify only agent's own changes present
```

### **CRITICAL SAFETY RULES**:
1. ‚ùå **NEVER auto-commit** without explicit verification
2. ‚úÖ **ALWAYS check git status** before file modifications
3. ‚ùå **NEVER commit changes made by other agents**
4. ‚úÖ **ALWAYS use [AGENT-ID] format** in commits
5. ‚úÖ **ALWAYS track file ownership** in session log

### **FILE OPERATION SAFETY WRAPPER**:
```bash
# Required before edit_file, search_replace, delete_file
safety_check() {
  local file=$1
  git status --porcelain "$file"
  git diff "$file"
  # Validate: file not modified by other agents
  # If other agent changes detected: STOP and coordinate
}
```

### **SESSION OWNERSHIP TRACKING**:
- **Session Log**: `.cursor/{agent_id}-session.log`
- **Track**: All files modified during session
- **Validate**: Only commit files in session log
- **Format**:
  ```yaml
  session: "AGENT-STARTUP-2025-06-28-001"
  start_time: "2025-06-28T07:45:00Z"
  files_modified:
    - file: ".cursor/workflows/startup.yml"
      action: "modified"
      lines: "10-25"
    - file: ".cursor/protocols/new-protocol.md"
      action: "created"
  ```

---

## üìä **MODULE B: CHANGE COORDINATION**
*Owner: Change Management Agent*

### **ACTIVE COORDINATION DASHBOARD**:
- **File**: `.cursor/ACTIVE_CHANGES.md`
- **Purpose**: Real-time work coordination
- **Update**: Mandatory for all agents

### **CHANGE RECORD TEMPLATES**:
```yaml
change_id: "CHANGE-{date}-{sequence}"
status: "IN_PROGRESS" # PLANNED | IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETED | ABANDONED
agent_id: "{agent_identifier}"
priority: "HIGH" # LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH | CRITICAL
files_affected: []
coordination_notes: "Instructions for other agents"
completion_criteria: "How to know it's done"
```

### **AGENT HANDOFF PROTOCOLS**:
1. **Session End**: Update all change statuses
2. **Session Start**: Read active changes before modifications
3. **Conflict Detection**: Coordinate via dashboard updates
4. **Emergency**: Document state and pause operations

---

## üöÄ **MODULE C: STARTUP INTEGRATION**
*Joint Ownership*

### **MANDATORY STARTUP SEQUENCE**:
```yaml
startup_protocol:
  1. git_safety_check:
     command: "git status --porcelain"
     action: "Document findings, detect conflicts"

  2. active_agents_check:
     file: ".cursor/ACTIVE_AGENTS.yml"
     action: "Check for concurrent sessions"

  3. change_coordination:
     file: ".cursor/ACTIVE_CHANGES.md"
     action: "Load ongoing work context"

  4. session_initialization:
     create: "{agent_id}-session.log"
     register: "ACTIVE_AGENTS.yml"

  5. safety_validation:
     verify: "No conflicts detected"
     proceed: "Begin coordinated work"
```

### **STARTUP WORKFLOW REVISIONS**:
- ‚ùå **REMOVED**: "COMMIT before AND AFTER every significant change"
- ‚úÖ **ADDED**: "CHECK git status, COORDINATE via dashboard, ONLY commit verified changes"

---

## üÜò **MODULE D: EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS**
*Joint Responsibility*

### **CONFLICT DETECTION**:
```yaml
triggers:
  - git_merge_conflicts: "automatic_pause"
  - simultaneous_file_edits: "coordination_required"
  - abandoned_changes: "handoff_protocol"
  - session_overlap: "agent_coordination"
```

### **EMERGENCY RESPONSE**:

## ‚úÖ **VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS**

### **Phase 1 Git Safety Validation**:
- [ ] Auto-commit removed from startup workflow
- [ ] Git status checks implemented before file operations
- [ ] [AGENT-ID] format deployed in all commits
- [ ] Session ownership tracking operational
- [ ] No git conflicts during implementation

### **Integration Validation**:
- [ ] ACTIVE_AGENTS.yml system operational
- [ ] Change dashboard coordination working
- [ ] Multi-agent conflict prevention active
- [ ] Emergency protocols tested
- [ ] Performance impact acceptable

---

## üö® **EMERGENCY COORDINATION**

### **If Conflicts Occur During Implementation**:
1. **AGENT-STARTUP**: Immediately update ACTIVE_AGENTS.yml with emergency status
2. **Change Management Agent**: Pause all modifications, document conflict
3. **Both**: Coordinate via `.cursor/EMERGENCY_COORDINATION.md`
4. **Resolution**: Joint debugging and conflict resolution
5. **Recovery**: Validate system integrity before proceeding

### **Emergency Contact Protocol**:
```yaml
emergency_file: ".cursor/EMERGENCY_COORDINATION.md"
format:
  incident_id: "EMERGENCY-{timestamp}"
  agents_involved: []
  conflict_description: ""
  proposed_resolution: ""
  status: "ACTIVE|RESOLVED"
```

---

## üéØ **ENFORCEMENT**

This protocol is **MANDATORY** for all agent operations. Violations risk:
- Data loss and corruption
- Operational conflicts
- System instability
- Development chaos

**ACTIVATION**: This protocol is ACTIVE immediately and supersedes all previous coordination directives.
