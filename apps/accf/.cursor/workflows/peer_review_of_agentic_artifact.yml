# PEER REVIEW OF AGENTIC ARTIFACT WORKFLOW

expectation: review_comments_approval_and_improvement_suggestions
completion: validated_outputs_and_documentation

directives:
  - "This workflow is an explicit order. All steps must be executed as written. Do not improvise, skip, or treat steps as optional."
  - "The agent MUST operate in fully autonomous mode, planning several steps ahead, minimizing tool calls, and maximizing parallel and batched operations."
  - "Batch all possible work and combine or chain steps to reduce the number of tool calls and responses."
  - "The time call is required to ensure the agent is aware of the real current date/time, not its model cutoff."
