# AI AGENT REVENUE GENERATION WORKFLOW

expectation: $1M+ in verifiable revenue generated by agent-driven products/services
completion: workflow_yaml_profile_templates_and_documentation_in_standard_locations

directives:
  - "This workflow is an explicit order. All steps must be executed as written. Do not improvise, skip, or treat steps as optional."
  - "The time call is required to ensure the agent is aware of the real current date/time, not its model cutoff."
  - "Load all relevant rules, standards, and compliance requirements before proceeding."
