# Refactoring Examples

## Command-Style → Pattern Recognition

**Before**: Step 1: Check query results, Step 2: Validate collection, Step 3: Investigate fields...
**After**: **Silent Failure Pattern** | **Signature**: Query succeeds but returns [] when data exists | **Implementation**: Collection validation → field validation → correction

## Workflow → Autonomous Triggers

**Before**: When user requests research: Start with web search, identify URLs, scrape content...
**After**: **Research Trigger**: "research"/"investigate" keywords | **Implementation**: web_search → scraping → tech_docs → synthesis

## Team Instructions → Encyclopedia Patterns

**Before**: Team members should ensure code follows DRY principles. Remember to write tests...
**After**: **DRY Violation Detection**: Repeated code blocks | **Test Coverage Validation**: Functions without tests

## Verbose → High-Density

**Before (98 lines)**: This rule provides comprehensive guidance for autonomous agents when they need to perform complex research operations...
**After (4 lines)**: **Research Orchestration** | **Trigger**: research keywords | **Implementation**: web_search → scraping → synthesis

## Optimization Targets
**Size**: 40-70% reduction | **Density**: >80% operational content | **Focus**: Autonomous recognition
**Quality**: Fast recognition, clear implementation, precise validation
