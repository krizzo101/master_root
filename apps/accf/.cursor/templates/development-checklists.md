# Development Checklists

## Pre-Development
**Requirements**: User needs, acceptance criteria, dependencies documented
**Architecture**: System design, database schema, API contracts, security considerations
**Environment**: Dev setup, version control, coding standards, linting, CI/CD pipeline

## Code Development
**Quality**: Style guidelines, single responsibility, documentation, configuration-based, error handling
**Security**: Input validation, SQL injection prevention, auth/authz, data encryption, security headers
**Performance**: Query optimization, indexing, caching, resource cleanup, memory management

## Testing
**Unit**: Business logic coverage >80%, edge cases, maintainable tests, mocked dependencies
**Integration**: API testing, database integration, external services, end-to-end workflows, error scenarios
**Security**: Vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, auth flow validation

## Pre-Deployment
**Build**: Production environment success, dependency locking, configuration management, versioning
**Deployment**: Script testing, migration preparation, rollback procedures, monitoring setup, health checks
**Documentation**: API docs, deployment guides, user docs, changelogs, known issues

## Post-Deployment
**Monitoring**: Health verification, performance metrics, error rate thresholds, user feedback, log aggregation
**Maintenance**: Backup procedures, disaster recovery, security patches, optimization opportunities, technical debt tracking

## Code Review
**Process**: Peer review, architectural validation, security assessment, performance review, test coverage verification
**Criteria**: Readability, coding standards, error handling, security practices, documentation completeness

## Version Control
**Branching**: Feature branches from main, naming conventions, atomic commits, no sensitive data, up-to-date branches
**Merging**: Passing tests, approved reviews, conflict resolution, descriptive commits, branch cleanup
