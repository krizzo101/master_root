# Complete Development Patterns

## Modern Stack Architecture
```
Development Environment 2025
├── Ruff (Format + Lint + Sort)  ← 100x faster than legacy
├── mypy (Type Checking)         ← Strict mode
├── pytest (Testing)             ← Coverage reporting
├── bandit (Security)            ← Vulnerability scanning
├── pre-commit (Automation)      ← Quality enforcement
└── Cursor + AI Models           ← AI-powered development
```

## Workflow Automation
```bash
# Complete development cycle
make dev         # Start session
git add .
git commit       # Triggers pre-commit hooks automatically
make pr-ready    # Final checks before PR
```

## Performance Metrics
- **Tool Speed**: 100x improvement with Ruff
- **Setup Time**: 3 minutes for new developers
- **Quality Checks**: Sub-second execution
- **Team Consistency**: 100% through automation

## Integration Points
- **Cursor IDE**: Native AI integration
- **Git Hooks**: Automatic quality enforcement
- **CI/CD**: Seamless pipeline integration
- **Team Workflow**: Consistent development experience
