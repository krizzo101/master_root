# Security Guidelines (Manual Include)

## OWASP Top Ten
- Prevent **SQLi**: parameterized queries / ORM placeholders.
- Defend **XSS**: escape user input, use CSP headers.
- Avoid **Broken Auth**: use JWT/OAuth2; rotate secrets.

## Secret Management
- Store secrets in vault (1Password, AWS Secrets Manager).
- Access via env vars at runtime; never commit credentials.

## Dependency Scanning
- Enable `github/codeql` + `npm audit` + `pip-audit` in CI.

## Secure Headers (Web)
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains`
- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'`

## Infrastructure
- Least-privilege IAM roles; no wildcard `*` policies.
- Use TLS 1.2+ for internal services.

## Logging
- Mask tokens/PII: credit cards, SSN, auth headers.

## Incident Response
- Log aggregation, alert on 4xx/5xx spikes.

# Security Standards (Optimized for GPT-4.1)

- Clarity & Directness: Use clear, imperative instructions.
- Batching & Parallelization: Batch compatible security checks and actions; execute in parallel where possible.
- Multi-Step Planning: Plan several steps ahead, identify batching opportunities, and optimize for efficiency.
- Persistent Autonomy: Continue until all objectives are met or explicitly told to stop; avoid unnecessary waiting for input.
- Tool-First Mandate: Always use available tools for every operation, preferring tool-based actions.
- Self-Review & Optimization: Review and revise plans for efficiency before acting.
- Evidence-Based Completion: Present clear evidence of completion before considering a task done.
