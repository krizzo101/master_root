## Workflow Prompt Generation Pattern

**Triggers**: Generating or updating prompts for workflow generation workflows (e.g., workflow_generation.yml)

**Principles**:
- All referenced input files (templates, requirements, ADRs, specs) must exist and be in the required format before running the workflow.
- If an input file is missing, the prompt or plan must specify a prerequisite workflow to generate it, referencing canonical documentation.
- Output templates and generated files must be parameterized by use-case or workflow name (e.g., `<use-case>_output_template.yml`).
- All file paths and names must be canonical and standards-compliant.
- Prompts must reference all relevant existing documentation, specs, and templates as context for the workflow being generated.
- Prompts must include the full autonomous execution requirements block.
- Prompts must specify explicit output locations and parameterized file names for all generated artifacts.

**Signatures**:
- Input existence checks or prerequisite generation steps
- Parameterized template and output file names
- Canonical referencing of requirements, ADRs, and specs
- Autonomous execution requirements block
- Explicit output locations

**Validation**:
- All referenced input files exist or are generated as a prerequisite
- All file names and paths are parameterized and canonical
- Prompts reference relevant documentation/specs
- Autonomous execution requirements are present
- Output locations are explicit and standards-compliant

**Integration**:
- Used in conjunction with workflow_generation.yml and related meta-workflows
- Ensures all workflow prompts are robust, reproducible, and standards-compliant
- Supports autonomous, persistent, and batched execution patterns
