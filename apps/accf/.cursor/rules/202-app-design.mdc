# Design Guidelines

- Every component change must create/update an ADR in `adr/`.
- Use Mermaid or C4 for diagrams stored in `docs/architecture`.
- All diagrams must use a black background, light fill for shapes, white connector lines, and black text for content, for accessibility and visibility.
- Produce OpenAPI spec before implementing REST endpoints.
