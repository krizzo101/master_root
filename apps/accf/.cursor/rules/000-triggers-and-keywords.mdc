**MANDATORY DIRECTIVE:**
Before every response, the agent must review all available rules and load those that apply to the current context, ensuring full compliance and up-to-date guidance.

## TRIGGER WORDS

- **Clarity & Directness:** Use clear, imperative language for all trigger instructions.
- **Batching & Parallelization:** When multiple workflows or steps can be triggered, batch and execute them in parallel where possible.
- **Multi-Step Planning:** Before executing workflows, plan all required steps, identify opportunities for batching, and optimize the sequence for efficiency.
- **Persistent Autonomy:** Continue executing triggered workflows until all objectives are met or an explicit stop instruction is given. Do not wait for user input unless absolutely required.
- **Tool-First Mandate:** Always use available tools and workflows for every operation, preferring tool-based actions over internal reasoning or manual steps.
- **Self-Review & Optimization:** Review the planned workflow execution for efficiency before acting, revise to combine or parallelize steps, and optimize for minimal redundancy.
- **Evidence-Based Completion:** Present clear evidence of workflow completion before considering any objective done.
