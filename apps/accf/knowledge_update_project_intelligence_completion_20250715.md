# Knowledge Update: Project Intelligence Tool Completion (Generated 2025-07-15)

## Current State (Last 12+ Months)

### Multi-Agent System Trends 2024-2025
- **Focus Shift**: From large language models to autonomous AI agents for future of work
- **Performance Improvements**: 40% reduction in communication overhead and 20% improvement in response latency
- **Advanced Frameworks**: LangGraph, Smolagents, and specialized multi-agent platforms
- **Context Optimization**: Emphasis on efficient context transfer between agents
- **Production Readiness**: Focus on deploying and scaling agents effortlessly

### Context Generation Best Practices
- **Modular Architecture**: Collector-based systems for extensible data collection
- **Context Package Optimization**: Lightweight, focused packages for remote agent consumption
- **Real-time Updates**: Change detection and incremental updates for accuracy
- **Tiered Packaging**: Default packages + detailed on-demand packages
- **Integration Patterns**: Seamless integration with existing agent orchestration systems

## Best Practices & Patterns

### Multi-Agent Context Management
- **Session Continuity**: Maintain context across agent interactions
- **Context Caching**: Cache successful patterns and insights
- **Proactive Collection**: Anticipate agent needs and collect relevant data
- **Quality Control**: Validate context accuracy and completeness
- **Performance Optimization**: Fast context generation (<30 seconds) and lightweight packages (<10KB)

### Project Intelligence Architecture
- **Collector Framework**: Modular, extensible data collection system
- **Context Package Builder**: Optimized packaging for different agent types
- **Integration Layer**: Seamless connection with existing agent systems
- **Automation**: Git hooks and change detection for real-time updates
- **Quality Standards**: Accuracy, completeness, clarity, and currency requirements

## Tools & Frameworks

### Current Multi-Agent Frameworks
- **LangGraph**: Low-level orchestration for stateful agents
- **Smolagents**: Open-source framework for collaborative multi-agent systems
- **Orq.ai**: Generative AI collaboration platform for agentic architectures
- **AutoGen**: Microsoft's multi-agent conversation framework
- **CrewAI**: Role-based multi-agent coordination

### Context Generation Tools
- **Vector Stores**: FAISS, Chroma, BigQuery for context storage
- **Embedding Models**: OpenAI, Vertex AI, custom embeddings
- **Document Processing**: LangChain document loaders and splitters
- **RAG Systems**: Retrieval-augmented generation for context enhancement
- **Memory Systems**: Conversation buffers and persistent context storage

## Implementation Guidance

### Enhanced Collector Implementation
1. **Project Purpose Collector**: Extract project essence and goals from documentation
2. **Development State Collector**: Track current progress and focus areas
3. **Workflow Collector**: Analyze development patterns and processes
4. **Agent Architecture Collector**: Map agent capabilities and interactions
5. **Constraints Collector**: Identify limitations and requirements

### Context Package Builder
1. **Default Package Generator**: Essential context for all requests
2. **Specialized Package Generator**: Task-specific context optimization
3. **Integration with ACCF System**: Connect with existing agent infrastructure
4. **Performance Optimization**: Fast generation and lightweight packages
5. **Quality Assurance**: Validation and accuracy checks

### Git Hook Automation
1. **Post-commit Hook**: Trigger updates on code changes
2. **Cheap Agent Integration**: Use gpt-4.1-mini for focused updates
3. **Change Detection**: Smart analysis of what needs updating
4. **Incremental Updates**: Only update changed components
5. **Version Tracking**: Maintain context history and timestamps

## Limitations & Considerations

### Technical Constraints
- **Performance Requirements**: Context generation must be fast and efficient
- **Memory Limitations**: Sessions are temporary and lost on server restart
- **File-based Persistence**: Use knowledge files for critical context
- **Integration Complexity**: Must work with existing ACCF system
- **Scalability**: Handle growing project complexity and multiple agent types

### Quality Considerations
- **Accuracy**: All information must be factually correct and current
- **Completeness**: Provide sufficient context for effective agent understanding
- **Clarity**: Use clear, direct language for agent comprehension
- **Currency**: Update context within 24 hours of major changes
- **Relevance**: Focus on information that helps agents make decisions

### Implementation Challenges
- **Monolithic Code**: Current collectors.py is 2,431 lines and needs refactoring
- **Separation of Concerns**: Poor separation in CLI module
- **Context Optimization**: Balance comprehensiveness with efficiency
- **Automation Reliability**: Ensure git hooks work consistently
- **Integration Testing**: Validate complete workflow with ACCF system
