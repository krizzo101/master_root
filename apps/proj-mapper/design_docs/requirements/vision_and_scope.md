# Vision and Scope

**Version:** 1.1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2023-11-06  
**Status:** Draft

## Document Purpose

This document defines the vision, scope, and boundaries for the Project Mapper system. It serves as the foundation for all other requirements documents and establishes the high-level objectives and constraints of the project, with specific focus on the system's "by AI, for AI" approach.

## Project Background

AI development agents operating within VSCode-based IDEs like Cursor need structured, efficient ways to understand codebases. These AI agents face challenges in accurately mapping project structures, understanding relationships between components, and efficiently utilizing context windows. Project Mapper addresses these challenges by automatically generating AI-optimized maps of Python projects that are specifically designed for consumption by AI development agents.

## Vision Statement

Project Mapper will revolutionize how AI development agents understand and interact with complex codebases by automatically generating comprehensive, token-efficient maps that reveal code organization, dependencies, and architectural patterns. This system—designed, developed, and maintained by AI agents—will serve as a specialized tool for AI assistants operating within Cursor IDE, maximizing their effectiveness through optimized project context delivery.

## Business Goals and Objectives

1. **Optimize AI Agent Effectiveness**

   - Increase AI development agent accuracy by 50% through improved context
   - Reduce token usage for project understanding by 40%

2. **Enable AI-Driven Development and Maintenance**

   - Create a system designed specifically for AI agent consumption
   - Structure all outputs for optimal AI parsing and understanding
   - Establish development patterns optimized for ongoing AI maintenance

3. **Maximize Cursor IDE Integration**

   - Provide seamless integration with Cursor IDE's AI capabilities
