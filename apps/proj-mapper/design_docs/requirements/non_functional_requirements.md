# Non-Functional Requirements

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** 2023-11-05  
**Status:** Draft

## Purpose

This document specifies the non-functional requirements for the Project Mapper system. These requirements address the operational qualities of the system rather than specific behaviors, with specific focus on optimizing for AI agent consumption within VSCode-based IDEs like Cursor.

## Requirements

### Performance Requirements

#### P-1: Response Time

The system must process and generate maps for projects with the following performance characteristics:

- Small projects (< 50 files): < 2 seconds
- Medium projects (50-200 files): < 5 seconds
- Large projects (200-500 files): < 15 seconds

#### P-2: Memory Usage

- The system should not consume more than 500MB of RAM during normal operation
- Peak memory usage should not exceed 1GB for projects up to 500 files

#### P-3: Map Generation Performance

- File map generation should be completed within 100ms per file on average
- Relationship maps should be generated within 500ms for a graph with up to 100 nodes

### Scalability Requirements

#### S-1: Project Size Scalability

- The system must support projects with up to 500 files in the initial version
- The architecture must allow for future extensions to support larger projects

#### S-2: Language Support Scalability

- The system must be architected to allow easy addition of new language parsers
- Adding support for a new language should not require changes to the core system architecture

### Reliability Requirements

#### R-1: Error Handling

- The system must continue processing files even if individual file parsing errors occur
- Errors in one file should not affect the analysis of other files
- All errors must be logged with appropriate context for debugging

#### R-2: Partial Results

- The system should provide partial results even when some files cannot be processed
- Partial results must be clearly marked as incomplete

### Compatibility Requirements

#### C-1: IDE Integration

- The system must integrate specifically with VSCode-based IDEs, with primary focus on Cursor IDE
- The system must provide outputs that can be consumed by AI development agents operating within Cursor IDE
- Output formats must be compatible with Cursor IDE's AI features and context retrieval mechanisms

#### C-2: Python Version Compatibility

- The system must be compatible with Python 3.8 and higher
- Dependencies must be selected to maintain this compatibility

### Output Requirements

#### O-1: Output Location and Naming

- All generated outputs must be stored in a `.maps` directory at the project root
- Maps must follow a consistent naming convention: `<maptype>_<timestamp>.json`
- Index files must be named `index_<timestamp>.json` and contain references to all generated maps
- Real-time maps must be stored in a `.maps/realtime` subdirectory with appropriate version indicators

#### O-2: Output Format Clarity

- Output maps must use a consistent, documented structure optimized for AI agent parsing
- JSON schema documentation must be provided for all output formats
- Maps must not include unnecessary metadata that would increase token consumption by AI agents

### AI Agent Consumption Requirements

#### AI-1: Output Structure Optimization

- All outputs must be optimized for consumption by AI development agents within the Cursor IDE
- Output formats must use deterministic ordering to ensure consistent AI parsing
- Map sections must be clearly labeled with standard prefixes to enhance AI recognition
- Output must balance completeness with conciseness to optimize for token efficiency

#### AI-2: Schema Version Support

- All outputs must include schema version information to ensure backward compatibility
- Schema changes must be documented with migration paths for AI agents

#### AI-3: Relationship Clarity

- Relationships between code elements must be explicitly labeled using standardized terminology
- Confidence scores must be included for inferred relationships to allow AI agents to make informed decisions
- Bidirectional relationships must be consistently represented
- Relationship types must be categorized to allow AI agents to filter based on relevance

#### AI-4: Map Chunking Support

- Large maps must support chunking with clear continuation markers
- Chunk references must follow a predictable pattern for easy AI reassembly
- Each chunk must include minimal context headers to enable independent processing
- Maximum chunk size must be configurable with defaults optimized for AI context windows

#### AI-5: IDE Context Integration

- Maps must include VSCode-compatible location references (file paths, line numbers)
- Output must be compatible with IDE-specific features in Cursor for AI agent navigation
- Symbol references must follow VSCode symbol reference conventions where applicable
- Maps should support direct linking between documentation and code references

### Extensibility Requirements

#### E-1: Pipeline Architecture

- The system must follow a pipeline architecture with clear input/output interfaces between stages
- Each pipeline stage must be independently testable and replaceable
- Pipeline stages must be composable to enable customized processing flows
- Extensions must be implementable via standard pipeline stage interfaces

#### E-2: Language Analyzers

- Adding support for new programming languages must be possible through a well-defined analyzer interface
- Documentation analyzers must be extensible to support new documentation formats
- Custom analyzers must be loadable through configuration without modifying core components

### Deployment Requirements

#### D-1: Installation

- The system must be installable via pip
- Dependencies must be clearly specified and minimal
- Installation must not require compiling native extensions

#### D-2: Platform Support

- The system must run on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems that support Python 3.8+
- File path handling must be consistent across platforms to ensure map consistency

## Test Criteria

Each non-functional requirement will be validated through specific test scenarios. Please refer to the [Testing Strategy](../appendices/testing_strategy.md) document for details on how each requirement will be validated, including AI agent consumption tests.
