## Development Best Practices

Throughout the testing and documentation implementation, ensure you follow these best practices:

1. **Version Control**

   - Make regular, atomic commits with descriptive messages
   - Commit after implementing each logical component or test suite
   - Follow the conventional commit format (e.g., "test: add integration tests for CLI")
   - Push changes to the remote repository regularly

2. **Documentation**

   - Write comprehensive docstrings for all test functions
   - Include type hints for all functions and methods
   - Document the purpose, parameters, and expected outcomes of each test
   - Create technical and user documentation following standards

3. **Testing**

   - Follow test-driven development practices
   - Achieve high code coverage across all subsystems
   - Test edge cases and error conditions thoroughly
   - Implement unit, integration, and system tests

4. **Code Quality**
   - Follow PEP 8 style guidelines and project-specific standards
   - Run linters and formatters before committing changes
   - Use meaningful test and variable names
   - Organize tests in a logical structure

## Scope Limitations

When working on this testing and documentation implementation step:

1. **Focus Only on Current Tasks**

   - Work exclusively on testing and documentation components
