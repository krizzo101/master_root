## Development Best Practices

Throughout the relationship mapping implementation, ensure you follow these best practices:

1. **Version Control**

   - Make regular, atomic commits with descriptive messages
   - Commit after implementing each logical component or feature
   - Follow the conventional commit format (e.g., "feat: implement RelationshipDetector class")
   - Push changes to the remote repository regularly

2. **Documentation**

   - Write comprehensive docstrings for all classes and methods
   - Include type hints for all functions and methods
   - Document the purpose, parameters, and return values of each function
   - Update README.md with information about the relationship mapping subsystem

3. **Testing**

   - Write unit tests for each component as you implement it
   - Achieve high test coverage for all functionality
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - Implement integration tests for component interactions

4. **Code Quality**
   - Follow PEP 8 style guidelines and project-specific standards
   - Run linters and formatters before committing changes
   - Use meaningful variable and function names
   - Break down complex functions into smaller, more manageable pieces

## Scope Limitations

When working on this relationship mapping implementation step:

1. **Focus Only on Current Tasks**

   - Work exclusively on the relationship mapping subsystem components
   - Do not implement output generation or user interface components
   - Do not modify analysis subsystem components beyond what's needed for integration

2. **Follow Instructions Precisely**

   - Complete ALL tasks outlined in this document
   - Implement components exactly as specified
   - Create only the files and classes listed in this prompt

3. **Expect Progressive Implementation**
   - This is the fifth implementation step in a sequential process
   - Additional prompts will be provided for subsequent implementation steps
   - Wait for specific instructions before proceeding to output generation implementation

## Tasks

1. Implement the Relationship Detector
2. Create the Confidence Scoring system
3. Develop the Relationship Graph models

I need your help implementing the Relationship Mapping Subsystem for the Project Mapper application. This subsystem is responsible for detecting, scoring, and managing relationships between code and documentation elements that were identified by the analyzers.

The relationship mapping subsystem should include:

1. **Relationship Detector**
   - Identify connections between code and documentation elements
   - Use various heuristics (name matching, content similarity, references)
   - Support different relationship types (defines, uses, describes, extends)
   - Handle both direct and indirect relationships

2. **Confidence Scorer**
   - Evaluate and score relationship strength
   - Combine multiple signals for scoring
   - Normalize scores across different relationship types
   - Provide confidence thresholds for filtering

3. **Relationship Graph**
   - Create and manage a graph structure for relationships
   - Support efficient querying of related elements
   - Allow traversal of relationship chains
   - Handle serialization and deserialization

4. **Relationship Service**
   - Integrate with the pipeline architecture
   - Process analysis results to build relationships
   - Expose APIs for accessing relationships
   - Optimize for performance with large projects

Implement these components with appropriate error handling, thorough documentation, and comprehensive tests. The code should follow our established quality standards and integrate with the existing core subsystem and analyzers.
