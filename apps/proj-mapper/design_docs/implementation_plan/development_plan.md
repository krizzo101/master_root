# Project Mapper Development Plan

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** 2023-11-10  
**Status:** Draft

## Document Purpose

This document defines the implementation plan for transforming the Project Mapper design documentation into a fully developed, tested, and implemented application. It outlines the phases, steps, dependencies, and key deliverables for the "by AI, for AI" development approach.

## Development Approach

The Project Mapper system will be implemented using a **Pipeline-Aligned Development with AI Optimization** approach. This approach:

1. Directly mirrors the pipeline architecture defined in the system design
2. Ensures each pipeline component is fully functional before proceeding
3. Maximizes "by AI, for AI" optimization opportunities
4. Provides natural integration points between components
5. Enables continuous validation against AI consumption requirements

This approach was selected because it best aligns with both the system architecture and the "by AI, for AI" development paradigm, providing a structured yet flexible framework that specifically optimizes for AI development and consumption.
