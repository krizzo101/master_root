## Overview
{
  "purpose": "MUST define the system boundaries to establish clear demarcation between system components and external entities.",
  "application": "SHOULD be applied during the initial design phase and whenever changes to the system architecture occur, ensuring all stakeholders understand the limits of the system's functionality.",
  "importance": "This rule matters as it facilitates effective integration, communication, and management of system components, reducing potential conflicts and misunderstandings in development and operational phases."
}

## system_boundary_definition

{
  "description": "This section outlines the key components and considerations for defining system boundaries within architectural design.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST identify all system components and their interactions to delineate the boundaries effectively.",
    "MUST specify external entities that interface with the system, including data sources, user interfaces, and third-party services.",
    "SHOULD document assumptions and constraints related to the system boundaries to clarify design decisions.",
    "MUST ensure that boundary definitions are reviewed and updated regularly as system architecture evolves.",
    "NEVER assume implicit boundaries; all definitions must be explicitly stated to avoid ambiguity."
  ]
}

## boundary_integration

{
  "description": "This section focuses on the integration points between the defined system boundaries and external systems.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST define integration protocols and data formats for all interactions across the boundaries.",
    "SHOULD assess potential security implications for each integration point and document mitigation strategies.",
    "MUST include error handling procedures for interactions crossing system boundaries to ensure system resilience.",
    "SHOULD evaluate the performance impact of boundary interactions and optimize as necessary.",
    "NEVER overlook the need for clear documentation of integration logic to facilitate future development and maintenance."
  ]
}

## stakeholder_communication

{
  "description": "This section emphasizes the importance of communicating system boundaries to all stakeholders involved in the project.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST disseminate boundary definitions to all project stakeholders to ensure a shared understanding.",
    "SHOULD hold regular meetings to discuss boundary implications and gather feedback from stakeholders.",
    "MUST include boundary definitions in project documentation and make them easily accessible to all team members.",
    "SHOULD encourage stakeholder involvement in boundary reviews to align expectations and requirements.",
    "NEVER assume that stakeholders will infer system boundaries without explicit communication."
  ]
}

<example>
system-boundary-definition Example

```python
# Example for system-boundary-definition
def example():
    # Implement according to standards
    pass
```

This example demonstrates how to implement system-boundary-definition according to the standards.

<danger>
{
  "critical_violations": [
    "NEVER neglect to explicitly define all external entities that interact with the system, leading to potential integration failures.",
    "NEVER assume that previous definitions of system boundaries are still valid without validation during architectural changes.",
    "NEVER use vague language or ambiguous terms when describing system boundaries, which can cause misunderstandings among stakeholders.",
    "NEVER overlook the necessity of regular reviews and updates of boundary definitions, risking outdated or incorrect boundary delineations.",
    "NEVER omit documentation of assumptions related to system boundaries, as this can lead to misinterpretation of the system's functionality."
  ],
  "specific_risks": [
    "Violating this rule may result in integration failures, where the system cannot communicate effectively with external services, causing downtime or data loss.",
    "Failure to define boundaries may lead to security vulnerabilities, as external entities might access system components not intended for public interaction.",
    "Not documenting assumptions can lead to inconsistent interpretations among team members, resulting in development errors and increased rework.",
    "Regularly ignoring boundary reviews can result in a system that is misaligned with business needs, leading to inefficiencies and increased costs.",
    "Ambiguous boundary definitions can confuse stakeholders, leading to misaligned expectations and potential project delays due to miscommunication."
