## Overview
{
  "purpose": "MUST define a systematic approach to calculating confidence levels in relationship mapping TO enhance the reliability of data interpretations.",
  "application": "SHOULD be applied whenever relationships are established or modified within the system, utilizing predefined algorithms that assess the strength and reliability of these relationships.",
  "importance": "This rule matters because accurate confidence calculations directly impact the decision-making processes, ensuring that the AI assistant provides trustworthy insights and recommendations based on relational data."
}

## confidence_calculation_methodology

{
  "description": "Details the methodology for calculating relationship confidence levels based on defined parameters.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST utilize a scoring system that evaluates relationship attributes such as frequency of interaction, shared interests, and historical collaboration.",
    "SHOULD apply weights to each attribute based on their relevance to the specific relationship context.",
    "MUST ensure that the total confidence score falls within a predefined range (e.g., 0 to 100) for consistency."
  ]
}

## data_sources

{
  "description": "Identifies the data sources that are required for accurate confidence level calculations.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST aggregate data from user interactions, feedback, and historical relationship data.",
    "SHOULD include external data sources where applicable, such as social media interactions or professional networks.",
    "MUST ensure data integrity and relevance by regularly updating the sources used for calculation."
  ]
}

## confidence_level_thresholds

{
  "description": "Establishes thresholds for interpreting confidence levels and their implications.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST define specific thresholds (e.g., low, medium, high) that correlate with actionable insights based on confidence scores.",
    "SHOULD provide guidelines on how to handle relationships that fall below the minimum acceptable threshold.",
    "NEVER disregard relationships with low confidence without further investigation, as they may still hold potential value."
  ]
}

{
  "critical_violations": [
    "NEVER calculate confidence levels without incorporating all relevant data sources, as this will lead to inaccurate assessments.",
    "NEVER ignore the predefined scoring system when evaluating relationship attributes, which can result in inconsistent confidence scores.",
    "NEVER allow confidence scores to fall outside the established range (0 to 100), as this compromises the reliability of the relationship mapping.",
    "NEVER overlook low-confidence relationships without conducting a detailed analysis, as valuable insights may be missed.",
    "NEVER apply uniform weights to all relationship attributes, as this can distort the confidence calculation based on context."
  ],
  "specific_risks": [
    "Inaccurate confidence calculations can lead to misguided decisions, causing the AI assistant to provide users with unreliable insights.",
    "Ignoring relevant data sources may result in a failure to identify key relationships, potentially undermining the effectiveness of the system.",
    "Presenting confidence scores that fall outside the defined range can confuse users and diminish trust in the system's assessments.",
    "Neglecting low-confidence relationships may cause missed opportunities for engagement or collaboration that could be beneficial.",
    "Uniform weighting can misrepresent the significance of certain attributes, leading to a miscalculation of relationship strengths."
