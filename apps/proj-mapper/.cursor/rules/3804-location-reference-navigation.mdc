## Overview
{
  "purpose": "MUST enable efficient navigation to location references within code TO facilitate rapid comprehension and editing of code structures.",
  "application": "SHOULD be applied whenever a user queries or interacts with code references in the IDE, ensuring that navigation links are readily available and functional.",
  "importance": "This rule matters because it enhances the developer's experience by reducing time spent searching for location references, thereby improving code productivity and reducing cognitive load."
}

## navigation_requirements

{
  "description": "Requirements for enabling navigation to code location references.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST provide clickable links for all code references that lead to their respective locations.",
    "SHOULD support keyboard shortcuts for navigating to location references to enhance accessibility.",
    "MUST ensure that all navigation links are contextually relevant and lead to accurate locations within the codebase."
  ]
}

## error_handling

{
  "description": "Guidelines for handling errors during navigation to location references.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST display a clear error message when a location reference link is broken or leads to a non-existent location.",
    "SHOULD offer alternative navigation options or suggestions when a direct link fails.",
    "MUST log navigation errors for debugging purposes to assist in maintaining link integrity."
  ]
}

## user_experience

{
  "description": "Best practices for optimizing user experience during navigation.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST provide visual feedback (e.g., highlighting or tooltips) when hovering over location reference links.",
    "SHOULD allow users to customize their navigation settings, such as link colors or styles, to improve visibility.",
    "NEVER obscure navigation links with other UI elements to ensure they are always accessible."
  ]
}

{
  "critical_violations": [
    "NEVER provide location links that lead to incorrect or outdated references within the codebase.",
    "NEVER allow navigation links to be non-clickable or unresponsive when accessed by the user.",
    "NEVER obscure location reference links with other UI elements, making them inaccessible to the user.",
    "NEVER implement navigation features that do not consider context, leading users to irrelevant code locations.",
    "NEVER ignore broken links without logging errors, which prevents troubleshooting navigation issues."
  ],
  "specific_risks": [
    "Providing incorrect location links can mislead developers, resulting in wasted time and potential introduction of errors into the code.",
    "Non-clickable navigation links hinder user productivity, causing frustration and reducing the overall efficiency of the coding process.",
    "Obscured links may lead to missed opportunities for code comprehension, increasing cognitive load and complicating code maintenance.",
    "Contextually irrelevant navigation can confuse users, causing them to lose track of their workflow and impairing their understanding of the code structure.",
    "Failure to log broken links prevents timely resolution of navigation issues, leading to persistent problems that degrade the user experience."
