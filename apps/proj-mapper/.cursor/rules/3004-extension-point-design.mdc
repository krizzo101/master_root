## Overview
{
  "purpose": "MUST define extension points to facilitate modular architecture that enables the integration of additional features without extensive reconfiguration.",
  "application": "SHOULD be applied during the architecture design phase WHEN identifying areas of the system that may require future enhancements or integrations, ensuring that these points are well-documented and easily accessible.",
  "importance": "This rule matters because it supports long-term maintainability and scalability of the system, allowing for easier updates and adaptability to changing requirements without compromising existing functionality."
}

## extension_points

{
  "description": "This section outlines the requirements for defining extension points within the architecture to ensure flexibility and modularity.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST identify and document all potential extension points during the architecture design phase.",
    "MUST ensure that each extension point has a clear interface definition to facilitate integration.",
    "SHOULD provide guidelines on how to implement extensions to maintain consistency across the codebase.",
    "MUST include versioning information for each extension point to manage compatibility effectively."
  ]
}

## modularity_guidelines

{
  "description": "This section provides guidelines on maintaining modularity through well-defined extension points.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST ensure that extension points do not introduce tight coupling between components.",
    "SHOULD promote the use of design patterns that support modular architecture, such as the Strategy or Observer patterns.",
    "MUST validate that extensions can operate independently and do not rely on internal states of the main system components.",
    "NEVER allow extension points to expose sensitive system internals that could compromise security or integrity."
  ]
}

## documentation_standards

{
  "description": "This section specifies the documentation standards for extension points to ensure clarity and ease of use.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST provide comprehensive documentation for each extension point, including purpose, usage examples, and potential pitfalls.",
    "SHOULD include diagrams or visual representations to illustrate the relationship between extension points and the main architecture.",
    "MUST keep documentation updated with each modification to the extension points to prevent discrepancies.",
    "NEVER assume that users will understand the context of an extension point without explicit documentation."
  ]
}

<example>
extension-point-design Example

```python
# Example for extension-point-design
def example():
    # Implement according to standards
    pass
```

This example demonstrates how to implement extension-point-design according to the standards.

{
  "critical_violations": [
    "NEVER define extension points without a clear interface specification.",
    "NEVER allow extension points to depend on internal implementations of the main system components.",
    "NEVER neglect to document the purpose and usage of each extension point.",
    "NEVER create extension points that introduce tight coupling between components.",
    "NEVER expose sensitive data or system internals through extension points."
  ],
  "specific_risks": [
    "Violating the rule by not providing a clear interface can lead to integration challenges, making it difficult for developers to implement extensions without breaking functionality.",
    "Dependency on internal implementations can cause extensions to fail when the main system is updated, leading to system instability and increased maintenance costs.",
    "Lack of documentation can result in misuse of extension points, causing confusion among developers and potential errors in implementation.",
    "Tight coupling introduced through poorly designed extension points can hinder the system's modularity, making future enhancements more complex and time-consuming.",
    "Exposing sensitive data through extension points can lead to security vulnerabilities, putting the entire system at risk of unauthorized access and data breaches."
