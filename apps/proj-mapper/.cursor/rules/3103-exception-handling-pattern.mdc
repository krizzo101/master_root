## Overview
{
  "purpose": "MUST establish a consistent pattern for exception handling in Python code TO enhance error management and ensure graceful degradation of functionality.",
  "application": "SHOULD be applied whenever exceptions are anticipated in the codebase, especially during input/output operations, network requests, and user interactions, ensuring that exceptions are caught and handled appropriately.",
  "importance": "This rule matters because effective exception handling contributes to program stability, reduces the likelihood of crashes, and improves user experience by providing meaningful feedback in case of errors."
}

## exception_handling_structure

{
  "description": "Define a structured approach to implement exception handling in Python to ensure clarity and maintainability.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST use try-except blocks to catch exceptions and prevent program crashes.",
    "SHOULD define specific exception types in the except clause to handle known error conditions explicitly.",
    "MUST include a finally block when resource cleanup is necessary to ensure proper resource management.",
    "SHOULD log exceptions using a logging framework to provide insights into error occurrences and facilitate debugging."
  ]
}

## best_practices

{
  "description": "Outline best practices for exception handling that enhance code quality and reliability.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST avoid using bare except statements; instead, specify the exception type to prevent catching unexpected exceptions.",
    "SHOULD provide informative messages in exceptions to clarify the context of the error when raising them.",
    "MUST not suppress exceptions without proper handling; ensure that every exception is either logged or handled appropriately.",
    "SHOULD use custom exception classes for domain-specific errors to improve code readability and error management."
  ]
}

## testing_and_validation

{
  "description": "Establish guidelines for testing exception handling implementations to ensure robustness.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST write unit tests to cover scenarios where exceptions are expected to occur, verifying that they are handled correctly.",
    "SHOULD implement automated tests that simulate error conditions to validate the effectiveness of exception handling.",
    "MUST ensure that the codebase is reviewed for proper exception handling practices during code reviews to maintain quality standards."
  ]
}

exception-handling-pattern Example

```python
# Example for exception-handling-pattern
def example():
    # Implement according to standards
    pass
```

This example demonstrates how to implement exception-handling-pattern according to the standards.

<danger>
{
  "critical_violations": [
    "NEVER use bare except statements in your code as it can lead to unintentional suppression of critical exceptions.",
    "NEVER catch exceptions without logging them; this obscures error occurrences and hinders debugging efforts.",
    "NEVER fail to include a finally block when dealing with resources that require cleanup, leading to resource leaks and instability.",
    "NEVER raise generic exceptions without providing context; this makes it difficult to identify the cause of errors.",
    "NEVER ignore specific exception handling for anticipated error types; always define the specific exceptions in the except clause."
  ],
  "specific_risks": [
    "Violating the bare except statement rule can result in hiding unexpected errors, causing the application to behave unpredictably and potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.",
    "Not logging caught exceptions can prevent developers from understanding the operational issues within the application, making troubleshooting difficult and time-consuming.",
    "Failing to clean up resources properly can lead to memory leaks and resource exhaustion, ultimately crashing the application or degrading its performance over time.",
    "Raising generic exceptions without context may leave users confused about what went wrong, leading to a poor user experience and loss of trust in the application.",
    "Ignoring specific exceptions can result in unhandled errors propagating through the application, potentially causing crashes or data corruption."
