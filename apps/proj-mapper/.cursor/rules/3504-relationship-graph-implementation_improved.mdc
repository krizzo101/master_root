  "overview": {
    "purpose": "MUST establish a relationship graph to represent data connections in a structured manner.",
    "application": "SHOULD be applied during the design phase of data models to ensure comprehensive mapping of relationships. This includes defining entities, their attributes, and the interconnections between them.",
    "importance": "This rule matters because it enhances the clarity and functionality of data visualization, making it easier for developers and data analysts to understand complex relationships within the data, leading to better decision-making and insights."

    "description": "Defines the structure and attributes of the relationship graph.",
    "requirements": [
      "MUST specify nodes to represent entities in the data model.",
      "MUST define edges to represent relationships between entities.",
      "SHOULD include attributes for nodes and edges to capture additional context, such as weights for edges representing relationship strength.",

    "requirements": [
      "MUST gather data from relevant sources and ensure accuracy before insertion.",
      "MUST utilize algorithms to optimize the insertion of nodes and edges to maintain performance, such as batch insertion techniques.",
      "SHOULD validate relationships during population to ensure they conform to defined business rules, including checking for referential integrity.",
      "NEVER allow duplicate nodes or edges within the graph to maintain data integrity, and MUST implement checks to enforce this."

  "graph_visualization": {
    "description": "Describes methods for visualizing the relationship graph effectively.",
    "requirements": [
      "MUST implement visualization tools that allow users to interact with the graph dynamically, such as zooming and panning capabilities.",
      "SHOULD provide filtering options to focus on specific entities or relationships, allowing users to customize their view.",
      "MUST ensure that visual representations are intuitive and reflect the underlying structure of the data, using color coding or shapes to differentiate types of nodes.",
      "NEVER compromise on accessibility; visualizations should be usable by individuals with varying levels of expertise, including screen reader compatibility."

  "danger": {
    "critical_violations": [
      "NEVER define a relationship graph without clearly identifying all entities and their attributes.",
      "NEVER allow undefined relationships between nodes in the graph.",
      "NEVER use a graph structure that introduces cycles, as this can lead to infinite loops in traversal algorithms.",
      "NEVER ignore performance optimization when inserting nodes and edges into the graph.",

    "specific_risks": [
      "Failure to properly define entities can lead to incomplete or inaccurate data representation, resulting in flawed analyses.",
      "Undefined relationships may confuse users and lead to incorrect data interpretations and decisions.",
      "Introducing cycles in the graph can cause algorithms to fail or hang, severely impacting system performance.",
      "By skipping validation during population, incorrect data relationships can proliferate, leading to systemic errors in data processing.",
      "Neglecting performance optimization can result in slow graph operations, affecting user experience and application responsiveness.",
      "Duplicate nodes or edges can lead to data ambiguity, making it difficult to determine the correct relationships and affecting overall data quality."
