    "purpose": "The purpose of this rule is to establish clear guidelines for the accurate representation of location data in generated outputs, ensuring consistency and reliability in referencing locations.",
    "application": "This rule MUST be applied whenever output generation involves location references. It MUST be adhered to during the design and implementation of any feature that outputs location-related information.",
    "importance": "This rule is crucial because accurate location references enhance user experience, reduce errors in data interpretation, and maintain the integrity of the system by ensuring that all location data is standardized and aligned with accepted reference standards."

      "Omitting the source of location data can diminish user trust and create liability issues if the data is found to be inaccurate.",
      "Using ambiguous or outdated location names can cause confusion among users, potentially leading to significant operational errors in location-dependent tasks.",
      "Lack of contextual information with location references can result in users misapplying the data, causing inefficiencies or incorrect decision-making."
