## Overview
{
  "purpose": "MUST ensure the completeness of element extraction during data analysis to provide accurate and reliable insights.",
  "application": "SHOULD be applied when performing any data extraction operations, especially when the integrity of the extracted elements impacts the overall analysis results.",
  "importance": "This rule is critical as incomplete element extraction can lead to flawed interpretations and decisions, undermining the effectiveness of the data analysis process."
}

## element_extraction_requirements

{
  "description": "Requirements for ensuring the completeness of element extraction during data analysis.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST identify all relevant elements in the data source prior to extraction.",
    "MUST validate the completeness of extracted elements against predefined criteria.",
    "SHOULD implement checks to verify that no essential elements are omitted during the extraction process.",
    "MUST document any assumptions made during the extraction that could affect completeness."
  ]
}

## element_extraction_verification

{
  "description": "Procedures for verifying the accuracy and completeness of extracted elements.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST conduct a post-extraction review to confirm all elements have been successfully extracted.",
    "SHOULD use automated tools to compare extracted elements against expected outputs for completeness.",
    "MUST provide a report detailing the completeness status of the extraction process, highlighting any discrepancies.",
    "NEVER assume completeness without performing thorough validation checks on extracted elements."
  ]
}

## element_extraction_documentation

{
  "description": "Guidelines for documenting the element extraction process to support reproducibility and accuracy.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST maintain detailed records of the extraction methods used and the elements targeted.",
    "SHOULD include versioning for extraction procedures to track changes over time.",
    "MUST ensure documentation is accessible and understandable for future reference by analysts.",
    "NEVER omit details regarding the selection criteria used for determining element relevance."
  ]
}

{
  "critical_violations": [
    "NEVER skip validation of extracted elements against completeness criteria.",
    "NEVER assume that all relevant elements have been extracted without conducting a thorough review.",
    "NEVER disregard documentation of extraction methods and assumptions that could impact completeness.",
    "NEVER ignore discrepancies found during the post-extraction review process.",
    "NEVER proceed with analysis if there is any uncertainty regarding the completeness of extracted elements."
  ],
  "specific_risks": [
    "Incomplete extraction of data elements can lead to inaccurate analysis results, resulting in poor decision-making.",
    "Failure to validate extracted elements may cause critical insights to be overlooked, leading to missed opportunities or risks.",
    "Neglecting to document the extraction process can hinder reproducibility, making it difficult for other analysts to verify results.",
    "Ignoring discrepancies in extraction completeness can result in flawed interpretations, eroding stakeholders' trust in the analysis.",
    "Proceeding with analysis without ensuring completeness can result in strategic mistakes, potentially causing financial losses or operational inefficiencies."
