# Meta Rules Router

<version>1.1.0</version>

## Overview

{
  "purpose": "Direct AI agents to appropriate meta-level rules",
  "application": "Use when requiring guidance on system-wide consistency",
  "adaptation": "Update as new meta rules are added to the system"
}

## Critical Rules

These rules MUST be loaded into context before each response. Use the `read_file` tool with the specified line counts to ensure complete rule ingestion:

1. `000-context-awareness` - 128 lines
   ```
   read_file(".cursor/rules/meta-rules/000-context-awareness.mdc", should_read_entire_file=false, start_line_one_indexed=1, end_line_one_indexed_inclusive=128)
   ```

2. `020-response-structure` - 283 lines
   ```
   read_file(".cursor/rules/meta-rules/020-response-structure.mdc", should_read_entire_file=false, start_line_one_indexed=1, end_line_one_indexed_inclusive=250)
   read_file(".cursor/rules/meta-rules/020-response-structure.mdc", should_read_entire_file=false, start_line_one_indexed=251, end_line_one_indexed_inclusive=283)
   ```

3. `030-reasoning-methods` - 267 lines
   ```
   read_file(".cursor/rules/meta-rules/030-reasoning-methods.mdc", should_read_entire_file=false, start_line_one_indexed=1, end_line_one_indexed_inclusive=250)
   read_file(".cursor/rules/meta-rules/030-reasoning-methods.mdc", should_read_entire_file=false, start_line_one_indexed=251, end_line_one_indexed_inclusive=267)
   ```

4. `050-advisor-behavior` - 173 lines
   ```
   read_file(".cursor/rules/meta-rules/050-advisor-behavior.mdc", should_read_entire_file=false, start_line_one_indexed=1, end_line_one_indexed_inclusive=173)
   ```

## Rule Processing Instructions

{
  "binding_nature": "ALL rules accessed via read_file MUST be processed with the SAME PRIORITY and BINDING AUTHORITY as those accessed via fetch_rules",
  "directive_recognition": "Directives in the format 'WHEN X TO Y you MUST Z' are BINDING INSTRUCTIONS that MUST be followed",
  "processing_steps": [
    "Read the COMPLETE rule content using the provided line count instructions",
    "Parse the rule content for directives and instructions",
    "Apply all directives with the same priority as fetch_rules directives",
    "Follow all instructions in the rule content",
    "Reference the rule when explaining decisions influenced by it"
  ],
  "critical_warning": "NEVER proceed with a response until you have fully ingested all required rule content"
}

## Rule Selection

- WHEN processing requests TO ensure continuity and relevance you MUST follow the context awareness rule by reading:
  ```
  read_file(".cursor/rules/meta-rules/000-context-awareness.mdc", should_read_entire_file=false, start_line_one_indexed=1, end_line_one_indexed_inclusive=128)
  ```

- WHEN creating rules for AI consumption TO ensure accurate algorithmic interpretation you MUST FORMAT rules with explicit directives as defined in:
  ```
  read_file(".cursor/rules/meta-rules/015-rule-ai-interpretability.mdc", should_read_entire_file=true)
  ```

- WHEN answering queries TO ensure clarity and completeness you MUST ENFORCE structured response patterns from:
  ```
  read_file(".cursor/rules/meta-rules/020-response-structure.mdc", should_read_entire_file=false, start_line_one_indexed=1, end_line_one_indexed_inclusive=250)
  read_file(".cursor/rules/meta-rules/020-response-structure.mdc", should_read_entire_file=false, start_line_one_indexed=251, end_line_one_indexed_inclusive=283)
  ```

- WHEN solving complex problems TO ensure thorough analysis and optimal solutions you MUST APPLY appropriate reasoning methods from:
  ```
  read_file(".cursor/rules/meta-rules/030-reasoning-methods.mdc", should_read_entire_file=false, start_line_one_indexed=1, end_line_one_indexed_inclusive=250)
  read_file(".cursor/rules/meta-rules/030-reasoning-methods.mdc", should_read_entire_file=false, start_line_one_indexed=251, end_line_one_indexed_inclusive=267)
  ```

- WHEN advising or assisting with tasks TO maximize value and efficiency you MUST adopt direct expert advisor behavior as specified in:
  ```
  read_file(".cursor/rules/meta-rules/050-advisor-behavior.mdc", should_read_entire_file=false, start_line_one_indexed=1, end_line_one_indexed_inclusive=173)
  ```

- WHEN missing needed rules or receiving feedback on mistakes TO ensure continuous improvement you MUST create or update rules following:
  ```
  read_file(".cursor/rules/meta-rules/070-rule-self-improvement.mdc", should_read_entire_file=false, start_line_one_indexed=1, end_line_one_indexed_inclusive=231)
  ```
