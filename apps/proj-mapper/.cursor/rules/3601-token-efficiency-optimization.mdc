## Overview
{
  "purpose": "MUST ensure the optimization of token usage during output generation to minimize resource consumption and enhance the efficiency of the AI assistant.",
  "application": "SHOULD be applied during all output generation processes, particularly in situations where resource constraints or performance issues are identified. This includes generating responses, code snippets, and any other textual outputs.",
  "importance": "This rule matters because optimizing token usage directly impacts the performance and cost-effectiveness of the AI assistant, allowing for faster response times and reduced operational costs, which is critical in high-usage environments."
}

## token_usage_optimization

{
  "description": "MUST implement strategies to minimize token usage during output generation processes.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST analyze the context of the request to determine the minimal necessary output length.",
    "MUST prioritize succinct responses by eliminating unnecessary words and phrases.",
    "SHOULD utilize concise data structures when providing code snippets or complex outputs.",
    "NEVER include excessive explanations unless specifically requested by the user.",
    "MUST ensure that any abbreviations or shorthand used are clear and contextually appropriate."
  ]
}

## context_analysis

{
  "description": "MUST evaluate the context of user requests to tailor output length and detail.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST assess user intent and adjust output accordingly to avoid superfluous information.",
    "SHOULD maintain a balance between brevity and clarity to ensure user understanding.",
    "MUST adapt the level of detail based on user expertise, providing more context for novice users and less for experienced ones.",
    "MUST log instances where token optimization is applied to analyze effectiveness over time."
  ]
}

## performance_monitoring

{
  "description": "MUST continuously monitor the impact of token optimization on performance metrics.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST track token usage statistics to identify trends and areas for improvement.",
    "SHOULD implement feedback loops to refine token optimization strategies based on user satisfaction and performance outcomes.",
    "MUST adjust optimization strategies based on real-time performance data and user interactions.",
    "NEVER compromise the quality of output for the sake of reducing token usage if it affects user experience negatively."
  ]
}

<danger>
{
  "critical_violations": [
    "NEVER include unnecessary filler words or phrases that do not contribute to the meaning of the output.",
    "NEVER generate verbose explanations when a concise response suffices, as this increases token usage unnecessarily.",
    "NEVER ignore user context and intent, leading to overly detailed outputs that waste tokens and confuse the user.",
    "NEVER sacrifice output clarity for the sake of brevity; ensuring user understanding is paramount, even in token optimization.",
    "NEVER utilize complex data structures that increase token count when simpler alternatives would suffice."
  ],
  "specific_risks": [
    "Increased operational costs due to higher token usage can lead to budget overruns, especially in high-usage scenarios.",
    "Poor user experience may result from unclear or overly verbose outputs, leading to decreased user satisfaction and engagement.",
    "Inefficient responses can cause the AI assistant to lag, affecting overall performance and responsiveness, which may deter users.",
    "Failure to optimize tokens can lead to unnecessary strain on system resources, potentially resulting in slower processing times and increased latency."
