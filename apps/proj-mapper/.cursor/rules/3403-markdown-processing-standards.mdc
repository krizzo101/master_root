## Overview
{
  "purpose": "MUST establish clear markdown processing standards TO ensure that all documentation is formatted consistently and adheres to best practices.",
  "application": "SHOULD be applied during the creation and review of markdown files, particularly when integrating documentation into projects, ensuring compliance with specified formatting guidelines.",
  "importance": "This rule matters because it enhances readability, facilitates maintenance, and promotes a uniform appearance across documentation, thereby improving the overall user experience and reducing cognitive load."
}

## markdown_syntax_requirements

{
  "description": "This section outlines the mandatory syntax rules for writing markdown documentation.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST use consistent header levels (H1, H2, H3) throughout the document to represent the hierarchy of information.",
    "MUST utilize bullet points or numbered lists for clarity when presenting multiple items.",
    "MUST ensure that all code snippets are enclosed in triple backticks with appropriate language identifiers for syntax highlighting.",
    "MUST include a blank line before and after each header to enhance readability."
  ]
}

## link_and_image_standards

{
  "description": "This section defines the standards for linking and embedding images in markdown documents.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST use descriptive alt text for all images to improve accessibility and SEO.",
    "MUST ensure that all links are functional and direct to relevant, up-to-date resources.",
    "SHOULD use relative URLs for internal links to maintain consistency across different environments.",
    "NEVER use broken links or outdated resources that could lead to confusion or misinformation."
  ]
}

## formatting_and_style_guidelines

{
  "description": "This section provides guidelines on the overall formatting and style of markdown documents.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST use a consistent font style and size throughout the document to ensure uniformity.",
    "SHOULD limit the use of italics and bold text to emphasize key points without overloading the reader.",
    "MUST avoid excessive use of colors or styles that could distract from the main content.",
    "MUST ensure proper alignment and spacing of paragraphs for better readability."

{
  "critical_violations": [
    "NEVER omit header levels when structuring markdown documents, as this leads to confusion regarding the hierarchy of content.",
    "NEVER use inconsistent bullet point styles or formats within the same document, which can disrupt the flow of information.",
    "NEVER leave code snippets without the proper triple backtick formatting, as this can lead to syntax highlighting issues and reduce code readability.",
    "NEVER include links that are broken or lead to outdated resources, as this undermines the reliability and relevance of the documentation.",
    "NEVER neglect to provide descriptive alt text for images, as this compromises accessibility and detracts from the user experience."
  ],
  "specific_risks": [
    "Violating header structure can make navigation through documents difficult, leading to user frustration and increased time to locate information.",
    "Inconsistent bullet points can confuse readers, resulting in misinterpretation of important details and potential errors in understanding instructions.",
    "Failure to properly format code snippets can result in miscommunication of technical information, which may lead to implementation errors by developers.",
    "Utilizing broken or outdated links can lead to misinformation and wasted time for users searching for relevant information, damaging the credibility of the documentation.",
    "Not including alt text for images can hinder accessibility for users with disabilities, which may lead to non-compliance with accessibility standards and exclusion of certain user groups."
