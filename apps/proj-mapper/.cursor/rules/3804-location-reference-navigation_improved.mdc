  "overview": {
    "purpose": "MUST enable efficient navigation to location references within code TO facilitate rapid comprehension and editing of code structures.",
    "application": "SHOULD be applied whenever a user queries or interacts with code references in the IDE, ensuring that navigation links are readily available and functional.",
    "importance": "This rule matters because it enhances the developer's experience by reducing time spent searching for location references, thereby improving code productivity and reducing cognitive load."

      "NEVER provide location links that lead to incorrect or outdated references within the codebase.",
      "NEVER allow navigation links to be non-clickable or unresponsive when accessed by the user.",
      "NEVER obscure location reference links with other UI elements, making them inaccessible to the user.",
      "NEVER implement navigation features that do not consider context, leading users to irrelevant code locations.",

      "Providing incorrect location links can mislead developers, resulting in wasted time and potential introduction of errors into the code.",
      "Non-clickable navigation links hinder user productivity, causing frustration and reducing the overall efficiency of the coding process.",
      "Obscured links may lead to missed opportunities for code comprehension, increasing cognitive load and complicating code maintenance.",
      "Contextually irrelevant navigation can confuse users, causing them to lose track of their workflow and impairing their understanding of the code structure.",
      "Failure to log broken links prevents timely resolution of navigation issues, leading to persistent problems that degrade the user experience.",
      "Neglecting to update navigation links after code modifications can lead to confusion and inefficiency."
