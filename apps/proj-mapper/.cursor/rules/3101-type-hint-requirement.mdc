## Overview
{
  "purpose": "MUST enforce the use of type hints WHEN defining functions TO enhance code clarity and facilitate better static type checking.",
  "application": "This rule should be applied in all Python codebases, particularly during the function definition phase, ensuring that each function has appropriate type annotations for its parameters and return values.",
  "importance": "Implementing type hints is crucial as it improves code readability, aids in debugging, and allows for better tooling support, ultimately leading to higher code quality and maintainability."
}

## type_hint_requirements

{
  "description": "Requirements for implementing type hints in Python functions.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST annotate all function parameters with their expected types.",
    "MUST specify the return type of the function using a type hint.",
    "SHOULD use 'Optional' for parameters that can accept None.",
    "SHOULD prefer specific types (e.g., 'List[int]', 'Dict[str, Any]') over general types (e.g., 'List', 'Dict') for clarity.",
    "NEVER omit type hints for public function interfaces in libraries."
  ]
}

## type_hint_best_practices

{
  "description": "Best practices for using type hints effectively.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST keep type hints consistent throughout the codebase.",
    "SHOULD use type aliases for complex types to enhance readability.",
    "MUST avoid circular references in type hints by using forward references when necessary.",
    "SHOULD document any non-obvious type hints in code comments to improve understanding.",
    "MUST ensure type hints are updated alongside code changes to maintain accuracy."
  ]
}

## type_hint_tooling

{
  "description": "Guidelines for leveraging tools that support type hints.",
  "requirements": [
    "MUST use static type checkers (e.g., mypy) to validate type hints during development.",
    "SHOULD integrate type hint checking into the continuous integration pipeline to enforce compliance.",
    "MUST utilize IDE features that provide type hinting support to improve developer experience.",
    "SHOULD consider using type hint generation tools to aid in maintaining type annotations."
  ]

type-hint-requirement Example

```python
# Example for type-hint-requirement
def example():
    # Implement according to standards
    pass
```

This example demonstrates how to implement type-hint-requirement according to the standards.

{
  "critical_violations": [
    "NEVER define a function without type hints for its parameters and return types.",
    "NEVER use ambiguous types like 'Any' or 'List' without specifying the contained types.",
    "NEVER ignore type hinting for public APIs in libraries that are intended for external use.",
    "NEVER allow functions to have an inconsistent application of type hints within the same codebase.",
    "NEVER fail to update type hints when modifying function signatures or logic."
  ],
  "specific_risks": [
    "Violating type hint requirements can lead to runtime errors that are difficult to diagnose due to lack of type information.",
    "Ignoring type hints may result in reduced readability and maintainability of the code, making it harder for new developers to understand the codebase.",
    "Failure to use type hints can lead to improper usage of functions, resulting in potential bugs and increased technical debt.",
    "Not adhering to type hinting standards can hinder the effectiveness of static analysis tools, leading to missed opportunities for early error detection.",
    "Inconsistent use of type hints can confuse developers and result in mismatches between expected and actual types, further complicating code interactions."
