# Project Mapper Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the focused implementation plan for completing the Project Mapper's core functionality. Based on analysis of the current codebase, several critical components are incomplete or non-functional. This plan provides a structured approach to complete the implementation with clear priorities and validation steps.

## Implementation Status

The current implementation includes:

- Basic project structure and package organization
- Command-line interface framework with command handling
- Configuration loading capabilities
- Pipeline architecture framework

The following critical components are missing or non-functional:

1. **File Discovery System**: Not properly identifying or categorizing files
2. **Python Code Analysis**: Not extracting code structure from Python files
3. **Relationship Mapping**: Not detecting relationships between code elements
4. **Output Generation**: Producing empty maps with no content

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Analysis (2-3 weeks)

1. **File Discovery Implementation**
2. **Python Code Analyzer**
3. **Documentation Analyzer**

### Phase 2: Relationship Mapping (2 weeks)

1. **Relationship Detection System**
2. **Confidence Scoring**
3. **Relationship Graph**

### Phase 3: Output Generation (1-2 weeks)

1. **Map Generator**
2. **AI Optimization**
3. **Storage Management**

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (1 week)

1. **Pipeline Integration**
2. **End-to-End Testing**
3. **Documentation Completion**

## Validation Approach

Each component must include:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual functions and edge cases
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing interaction with other components
3. **Functional Validation**: Verifying the component produces expected outputs
4. **Documentation**: Complete API documentation and usage examples

## Next Steps

Proceed with the implementation guides for each critical component, starting with File Discovery and Python Analyzer.
