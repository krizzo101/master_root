| Integration & Refinement | 10%              | Testing and documentation         |

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be deemed successful when:

1. All unit, integration, and system tests pass
2. The system can analyze a medium-sized Python project (50+ files) in under 30 seconds
3. Generated maps accurately represent the project structure
4. The system can handle incremental updates efficiently
5. Documentation is complete and accurate

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to implementing the Project Mapper system over a 12-week period. By following this plan, the development team can ensure focused delivery of critical functionality first, while systematically building toward a complete and robust system.

The iterative approach allows for validation and course correction throughout the implementation process, ensuring that the final system meets all requirements and performs efficiently even with large projects.
