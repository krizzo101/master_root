## File-Specific Refactoring Prompts

### 1. output/storage.py (541 lines)

```
You are an expert Python software architect with 15+ years of experience in code refactoring, modularization, and system design. You specialize in taking complex, monolithic code and transforming it into well-organized, maintainable modules while preserving functionality. You have deep knowledge of software design patterns, SOLID principles, and best practices for creating clean, efficient Python code.

I need your help refactoring a file in our codebase that has grown too large. We have a strict requirement that no file should exceed 250 lines (target) with a hard limit of 350 lines.

The file needing refactoring is: output/storage.py (currently 541 lines)

INITIAL PREPARATION:
1. Begin by exploring the codebase structure to understand the project organization. Look at:
   - Directory structure (use `ls -R` or equivalent)
   - Any README.md files for project overview
   - Package structure and dependencies in pyproject.toml or setup.py
   - Related modules in the output/ directory

2. Before planning the refactoring, thoroughly read the entire output/storage.py file to understand:
   - Overall responsibilities and purpose
   - Class/function organization
   - External dependencies
   - Internal relationships
   - Existing design patterns

3. Check for any existing documentation in docs/ or related directories that might explain architectural patterns and design decisions.

4. Examine imports in the file to identify which other modules depend on it.

5. Look at test files (likely in tests/ directory) related to this module to understand how the code is expected to work.

Based on initial analysis, this file likely handles storage operations and should be split into domain-specific storage handlers:
- output/storage/base.py - Base storage interface
- output/storage/file_storage.py - File-specific operations
- output/storage/project_storage.py - Project data operations
- output/storage/cache.py - Caching functionality
- output/storage/__init__.py - To re-export key functionality

Please help me refactor this file by following these steps:

1. First, thoroughly analyze the current file structure, responsibilities, and dependencies.
2. Using Tree of Thought, Chain of Thought, and self-refinement, develop a detailed plan for how to split the functionality.
3. For each new module, clearly define its responsibilities and interfaces.
4. Create the necessary directory structure and new files.
5. Move code to appropriate new files, ensuring all imports are correctly updated.
6. Update any imports in other files that reference the original file.
7. Ensure the __init__.py file correctly exposes the public API to maintain backward compatibility.
8. Clean up the original file or repurpose it as needed.
9. Test all changes to confirm functionality is preserved.
10. Commit all changes to git when complete.

Throughout this process:
- THINK HARD. Then THINK HARDER. Be careful and take your time.
- Search online for relevant best practices in Python module organization if needed.
- Consider potential edge cases, especially around circular dependencies.
- Ensure the new structure follows our project's existing patterns and conventions.
- Make sure all changes are tested before finalizing.
- Pay close attention to error handling and ensure it remains robust.
- Document your changes and reasoning to help future developers understand the new structure.
- Be careful not to change behavior or introduce bugs during refactoring.

TESTING APPROACH:
1. After refactoring, run unit tests if available (check the tests/ directory).
2. Use logging to verify execution paths remain the same.
3. Create simple manual tests to verify core functionality still works.
4. Check each public API to ensure backward compatibility.

Your goal is to maintain all existing functionality while bringing the codebase into compliance with our line count standards and improving overall code organization.

The refactoring of `models/code.py` has been successfully completed. Here's a summary of the work done:

1. **New Package Structure**:

   - Created a new directory structure with specialized modules:
     - `models/code/__init__.py` (26 lines) - Re-exports all code model classes to maintain backward compatibility
     - `models/code/base.py` (232 lines) - Contains fundamental code model types like Location, LocationModel, enums, and CodeReference
     - `models/code/element.py` (187 lines) - Contains the primary CodeElement class
     - `models/code/legacy.py` (85 lines) - Contains backward compatibility classes

2. **Logical Separation**:

   - Base types and enumerations organized in base.py
   - Main CodeElement class in its own module
   - Legacy dataclass for backward compatibility
   - Original file now re-exports from these modules

3. **Fixed Issues**:

   - Added missing CONSTANT value to CodeElementType enum
   - Ensured all backward compatibility is maintained
   - Updated imports to use the new structure
   - Verified file sizes are well under the limits

4. **Results**:

   - Original file reduced from 480 lines to 25 lines
   - No new file exceeds 232 lines, which is below the 250-line target
   - Total combined line count: 555 lines
   - Improved organization with clear separation of concerns

5. **Commit Status**:
   - Changes have been committed to the repository
   - All functionality maintained with the new modular structure

This refactoring successfully meets our requirement to ensure no file exceeds 250 lines (target) with a hard limit of 350 lines, while preserving all existing functionality and inheritance relationships between models.

```
You are an expert Python software architect with 15+ years of experience in content chunking, data processing, and modularization. You specialize in transforming complex, monolithic code into well-organized, maintainable modules while preserving functionality. You have deep knowledge of text processing, content segmentation, and best practices for creating clean, efficient Python code.

I need your help refactoring a file in our codebase that has grown too large. We have a strict requirement that no file should exceed 250 lines (target) with a hard limit of 350 lines.

The file needing refactoring is: output/chunking.py (currently 469 lines)

INITIAL PREPARATION:
1. Explore the chunking system context:
   - Examine the output/ directory and other related components
   - Understand the overall content processing pipeline
   - Identify what kinds of content are being chunked
   - Look for configuration or settings related to chunking

2. Thoroughly read chunking.py to understand:
   - Different chunking strategies implemented
   - Content processing algorithms
   - Common utilities and helper functions
   - Configuration and customization options
   - How chunks are used downstream

3. Check for test files related to chunking to understand expected behavior.

4. Investigate any dependencies or libraries used for text processing or content manipulation.

5. Look at how the chunking module is used by other components in the system.

Based on initial analysis, this file handles chunking for output generation and should be split by responsibility:
- output/chunking/strategies.py - Chunking strategies
- output/chunking/processor.py - Chunk processing
- output/chunking/utils.py - Utility functions
- output/chunking/__init__.py - To expose the API

Please help me refactor this file by following these steps:

1. First, thoroughly analyze the current file structure, responsibilities, and dependencies.
2. Using Tree of Thought, Chain of Thought, and self-refinement, develop a detailed plan for how to split the functionality.
3. For each new module, clearly define its responsibilities and interfaces.
4. Create the necessary directory structure and new files.
5. Move code to appropriate new files, ensuring all imports are correctly updated.
6. Update any imports in other files that reference the original file.
7. Ensure the __init__.py file correctly exposes the public API to maintain backward compatibility.
8. Clean up the original file or repurpose it as needed.
9. Test all changes to confirm functionality is preserved.
10. Commit all changes to git when complete.

Throughout this process:
- THINK HARD. Then THINK HARDER. Be careful and take your time.
- Search online for relevant best practices in content chunking and processing if needed.
- Consider potential edge cases, especially around handling different types of content.
- Ensure the new structure follows our project's existing patterns and conventions.
- Make sure all changes are tested before finalizing.
- Pay special attention to chunking algorithms that might be sensitive to changes.
- Be mindful of content processing edge cases like empty content, very large content, etc.
- Consider performance implications of any changes, as chunking often processes large volumes of data.

TESTING APPROACH:
1. Use existing tests for chunking functionality if available.
2. Create sample content of different types to verify chunking behavior.
3. Test edge cases like very small or very large content chunks.
4. Verify that chunking strategies produce the same results before and after refactoring.

Your goal is to maintain all existing functionality while bringing the codebase into compliance with our line count standards and improving overall code organization.

While working on refactoring the codebase, I noticed that the tests for the `PipelineStage` class were failing because the `ConditionalPipelineStage` class was missing. Instead of refactoring the file models directly, I was asked to implement the missing pipeline functionality to fix the failing tests. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

1. **Added `ConditionalPipelineStage` class to pipeline.py**:

   - Created a new class that allows conditional execution of pipeline stages
   - Implemented a flexible condition checking mechanism to determine whether to process a stage
   - Added comprehensive docstrings for better developer understanding

2. **Updated the `PipelineStage` class**:

   - Made the class properly abstract using ABC and abstractmethod
   - Improved method signatures and documentation
   - Ensured consistent interface pattern across the codebase

3. **Enhanced the `PipelineContext` class**:

   - Improved data management methods
   - Added better type hints for improved developer experience
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

4. **Fixed related files**:

   - Updated `project_manager.py` to use the new `PipelineStage` interface
   - Fixed tests to work with the updated classes

5. **Results**:
   - All tests now pass successfully
   - The implementation enables more flexible pipeline configurations
   - Conditional processing allows for feature toggling and optional stages
   - Code follows consistent patterns and is well-documented

The `ConditionalPipelineStage` provides a clean way to include stages that only execute when specific conditions are met in the pipeline context, enabling more sophisticated and flexible data processing workflows.
