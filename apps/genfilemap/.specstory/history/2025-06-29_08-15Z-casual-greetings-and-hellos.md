<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user has said "howdy" which is a casual greeting. I should respond in a friendly way and offer to help them with their project. Looking at the project layout, this appears to be a "genFileMap" project - some kind of tool for generating file maps or analysis of codebases. I should greet them back and ask how I can help with their project.

I don't need to use any tools for this simple greeting, but I should be ready to help with their codebase if they have any questions or tasks.</details></think>
