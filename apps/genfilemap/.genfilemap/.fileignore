# GenFileMap ignore file
#
# This file works similarly to .gitignore - it specifies patterns for files
# that should be ignored when processing with genfilemap.
#
# Lines starting with # are comments and are ignored.
# Each line is a file pattern which tells genfilemap to ignore those files.
# Empty lines are ignored.
