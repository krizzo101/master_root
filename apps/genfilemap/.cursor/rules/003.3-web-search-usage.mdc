### Web Search Usage

- Use Cursor IDEâ€™s native web search for any info that may be outdated or unclear.
- Mandatory for checking current tech, best practices, compatibility, troubleshooting, and recent developments.
- Make queries specific: include version, year (e.g., 2024/2025), technology, and unique error text.
- Prioritize official docs, recent sources, and cross-verify critical info.
- Analyze sources for date, authority, and consensus.
- Log key findings and sources for future reference.
- Refine queries as needed; start broad, then narrow focus.
- Always cite sources and include verification dates for all recommendations.
