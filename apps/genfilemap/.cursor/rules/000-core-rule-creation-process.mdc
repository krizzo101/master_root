"1. To create a new rule: create or edit a .md file in the .cursor/ directory.",
"2. To edit an existing rule: copy the .mdc file from .cursor/rules/ to .cursor/ as a .md, and make a backup in .cursor/backup/rules/<original filename>.<timestamp> before editing.",
"3. Ensure the file follows the style guide ([000-cursor-rules-style-guide.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/000-cursor-rules-style-guide.mdc)) and passes all validation (the style guide is auto-applied to .cursor/\*.md).",
"4. Once finalized, move and rename the file to .cursor/rules/ with a .mdc extension.",
"5. Do not attempt to edit .mdc files in .cursor/rules/ directly, as changes may not persist due to system restrictions.",
"6. This process ensures that the style guide ([000-cursor-rules-style-guide.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/000-cursor-rules-style-guide.mdc)) is always enforced and that rule files are reliably created and maintained."

Always reference and follow the style guide ([000-cursor-rules-style-guide.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/000-cursor-rules-style-guide.mdc)) by direct link to ensure discoverability and compliance.",

"All new or modified rule files must be created as .md in .cursor/.",
"The style guide must be enforced on all .md files in .cursor/.",
"Finalized rule files must be moved and renamed to .mdc in .cursor/rules/.",
"No direct edits to .mdc files in .cursor/rules/ are permitted.",
"All edits to existing rules must be backed up in .cursor/backup/rules/ with a timestamp before modification."
