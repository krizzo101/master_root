# SDLC Framework Analysis - Key Findings

## Critical Context for Future Work

### The Core Problem We're Solving
- 30+ duplicate RAG/agent/coding systems that don't quite work
- No compound progress - always starting from scratch
- Agents jump straight to coding without thinking/planning
- Components declared "done" but don't actually work

### What Exists
1. **SDLC Command** (`/home/opsvi/master_root/.claude/commands/sdlc.md`)
   - Defines 7 phases with deliverables
   - Currently missing enforcement activation
   - Has phase-specific agents configured

2. **SDLC Enforcer Tools** (in `/libs/opsvi_mcp/tools/`)
   - `sdlc_enforcer_strict.py` - Can block operations by phase
   - `sdlc_enforcer_scoped.py` - Project-scoped enforcement
   - Works via: `python /path/to/sdlc_enforcer_strict.py activate "<project>"`
   - Creates state files in `.proj-intel/`

3. **Resource Discovery** - MCP tools to find existing code
   - `mcp__resource_discovery__search_resources()`
   - `mcp__resource_discovery__check_package_exists()`
   - Prevents duplicate implementations

4. **Knowledge System** - Captures what works/doesn't
   - Stores patterns, errors, solutions
   - Cross-agent learning

### Key Issue Discovered
- **Enforcer exists but isn't activated** in SDLC doc
- Originally had: `enforcer = ScopedSDLCEnforcer(); project = enforcer.create_project(...)`
- Was removed and replaced with: "DO NOT import Python modules directly!"
- Result: No enforcement happening

### The Right Solution (Artifact-Based Gates)
Instead of complex enforcement, use simple file-based checkpoints:

```
.sdlc/
├── discovery-complete.json    # Must exist before design
├── design-complete.json       # Must exist before development
├── tests-passing.json         # Must exist before deployment
└── project-state.json         # Current phase and metadata
```

Each phase:
1. Checks for previous phase's artifact
2. Cannot proceed without it
3. Creates its own artifact when complete

### Why This Works
- Simple - no complex mechanisms
- Verifiable - artifacts prove completion
- Compatible with MCP's stateless architecture
- Claude naturally follows instructions to check files

### Next Steps
1. Update SDLC doc to use artifact-based gates
2. Add clear "Before you can X, check for Y" instructions
3. Make first step create `.sdlc/project-state.json`
4. Each phase creates completion artifact

### Remember
- User wants framework/guardrails, not hard enforcement
- Enforcer was meant as failsafe, not primary method
- Goal is compound progress - each project builds on previous
- Must actually work, not "mostly work"
