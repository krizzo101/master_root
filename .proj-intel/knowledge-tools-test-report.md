# Knowledge Tools Test Report

**Date**: 2025-08-16
**Testing Session**: Knowledge Tools Validation

## Summary
Tested all knowledge tool functions to validate functionality and identify issues.

## Test Results

### 1. knowledge_store
**Status**: ❌ FAILED
**Issues Found**:
- Parameter validation errors with tags and context fields
- Unexpected keyword argument 'auto_embed' error
- Tool appears to have implementation issues with parameter handling

### 2. knowledge_query
**Status**: ❌ FAILED (Auth Issue)
**Issues Found**:
- Neo4j authentication failure: "Neo.ClientError.Security.Unauthorized"
- Database connection not properly configured
- Need to set NEO4J_URI, NEO4J_USER, and NEO4J_PASSWORD environment variables

### 3. knowledge_update
**Status**: ❌ FAILED (Auth Issue)
**Issues Found**:
- Same Neo4j authentication failure as query function
- Cannot test actual update logic due to auth issues

### 4. knowledge_relate
**Status**: ❌ FAILED (Auth Issue)
**Issues Found**:
- Same Neo4j authentication failure
- Cannot create relationships between knowledge entries

### 5. knowledge_read
**Status**: ✅ PARTIAL SUCCESS
**Notes**:
- Successfully generates Cypher query and parameters
- Returns query structure for manual execution via mcp__db__read_neo4j_cypher
- When executed directly, successfully retrieved 5 knowledge entries from database
- This suggests the database has data but direct knowledge tools have auth issues

## Key Findings

### Database Status
- Neo4j database contains existing knowledge entries
- Direct Cypher queries work via mcp__db tools
- Knowledge tools wrapper has authentication issues

### Existing Knowledge Entries Found
1. Multi-Agent Orchestration Architecture Patterns (confidence: 0.95)
2. SDLC Git Integration workflow (confidence: 0.95, success_rate: 1.0)
3. Git Branching Strategy for AI Factory (confidence: 1.0, success_rate: 1.0)
4. Git Commit Standards (confidence: 0.95, success_rate: 1.0)
5. Saga Pattern for Distributed Agent Transactions (confidence: 0.92)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Configure Neo4j authentication environment variables
2. Fix knowledge_store parameter validation issues
3. Review auto_embed parameter implementation

### Workarounds
- Use mcp__db__read_neo4j_cypher directly for reading knowledge
- Use mcp__db__write_neo4j_cypher for storing new knowledge
- Build Cypher queries manually until knowledge tools are fixed

### Example Working Query
```cypher
MATCH (k:Knowledge)
RETURN k.content as content, k.knowledge_type as type,
       k.confidence_score as confidence, k.success_rate as success_rate
ORDER BY k.updated_at DESC
LIMIT 5
```

## Conclusion
Knowledge tools have implementation issues but the underlying Neo4j database is functional and contains valuable knowledge entries. Direct Cypher queries can be used as a workaround.
