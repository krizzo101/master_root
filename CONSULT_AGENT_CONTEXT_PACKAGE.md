## üìä **Context Summary for Consult Agent**

### **Current State**
- **11 legacy codebases** with ~5,500 Python files total
- **OPSVI architecture** defines 16 specialized libraries in 4 categories
- **88% coverage** possible through migration (4,840 files)
- **2 foundation libraries** need to be built from scratch

### **Key Codebases**
1. **`agent_world`** (1,511 files) - Multi-agent orchestration platform
2. **`docRuleGen`** (1,585 files) - Document processing and rule generation
3. **`master`** (1,327 files) - Multi-agent coordination system
4. **`auto_forge`** (314 files) - Autonomous software factory
5. **`asea`** (348 files) - SDLC workflow automation
6. **Graph RAG Systems** (191 files) - 4 specialized RAG implementations
7. **Supporting Systems** (38 files) - Monitoring and visualization

### **OPSVI Library Categories**
- **Core Libraries (4)**: Foundation, core, runtime, utils
- **Service Libraries (6)**: LLM, RAG, HTTP, FS, data, communication
- **Manager Libraries (6)**: Agents, pipeline, orchestration, deploy, monitoring, security, gateway

### **Migration Challenges**
- **Foundation layer** completely missing (must build from scratch)
- **Complex dependencies** between codebases
- **Production stability** requirements during migration
- **Quality standards** must be maintained throughout

### **Success Criteria**
- **88% code coverage** through migration
- **Zero production incidents** during migration
- **Performance maintained** within 10% of baseline
- **Security posture improved** with new libraries

3. **Dependency Management**: How should I handle the complex dependencies between the 11 codebases during migration?

4. **Quality Gates**: What quality gates should I establish for each phase to ensure production readiness?

5. **Strangler-Fig Implementation**: How should I implement the strangler-fig pattern for safe migration?

6. **Resource Allocation**: What team structure and resource allocation would you recommend for this migration?

7. **Integration Testing**: What integration testing approach would ensure system stability throughout migration?

8. **Risk Mitigation**: What are the key risks and how should I mitigate them?

9. **Timeline Optimization**: How can I optimize the timeline while maintaining quality and safety?

10. **Success Metrics**: What specific metrics should I track to ensure successful migration?
