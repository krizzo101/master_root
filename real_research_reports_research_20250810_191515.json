We aim to delve deeper\ninto global regulatory approaches towards AI use in healthcare, with a focus on\nhow common themes are emerging globally. We compare these themes to the World\nHealth Organization's (WHO) regulatory considerations and principles on ethical\nuse of AI for healthcare applications. Our work seeks to take a global\nperspective on AI policy by analyzing 14 legal jurisdictions including\ncountries representative of various regions in the world (North America, South\nAmerica, South East Asia, Middle East, Africa, Australia, and the\nAsia-Pacific). Our eventual goal is to foster a global conversation on the\nethical use of AI in healthcare and the regulations that will guide it. We\npropose solutions to promote international harmonization of AI regulations and\nexamine the requirements for regulating generative AI, using China and\nSingapore as examples of countries with well-developed policies in this area.\n",

With the increasingly\nindispensable role of AI in healthcare, there are growing concerns over the\nlack of transparency and explainability in addition to potential bias\nencountered by predictions of the model. This is where Explainable Artificial\nIntelligence (XAI) comes into the picture. XAI increases the trust placed in an\nAI system by medical practitioners as well as AI researchers, and thus,\neventually, leads to an increasingly widespread deployment of AI in healthcare.\n  In this paper, we present different interpretability techniques. The aim is\nto enlighten practitioners on the understandability and interpretability of\nexplainable AI systems using a variety of techniques available which can be\nvery advantageous in the health-care domain. Medical diagnosis model is\nresponsible for human life and we need to be confident enough to treat a\npatient as instructed by a black-box model.

Text classification is a fundamental task in NLP,\nwhich aims to classify text into different predefined categories. Text\nclassification is the most basic and classic task in natural language\nprocessing, and most of the tasks in natural language processing can be\nregarded as classification tasks. In recent years, deep learning has achieved\ngreat success in many research fields, and today, it has also become a standard\ntechnology in the field of NLP, which is widely integrated into text\nclassification tasks. Unlike numbers and images, text processing emphasizes\nfine-grained processing ability. Traditional text classification methods\ngenerally require preprocessing the input model's text data. Additionally, they\nalso need to obtain good sample features through manual annotation and then use\nclassical machine learning algorithms for classification. Therefore, this paper\nanalyzes the application status of deep learning in the three core tasks of NLP\n(including text representation, word order modeling, and knowledge\nrepresentation). This content explores the improvement and synergy achieved\nthrough natural language processing in the context of text classification,\nwhile also taking into account the challenges posed by adversarial techniques\nin text generation, text classification, and semantic parsing. An empirical\nstudy on text classification tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of\ninteractive integration training, particularly in conjunction with TextCNN,\nhighlighting the significance of these advancements in text classification\naugmentation and enhancement.\n",

Traditional Least\nSignificant Bit (LSB) steganography techniques face challenges in accuracy and\nrobustness of information extraction when dealing with complex character\nencoding, such as Chinese characters.
