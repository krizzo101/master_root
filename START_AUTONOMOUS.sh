Build a complete RESEARCH-DRIVEN autonomous coding system.

CRITICAL: Before implementing ANYTHING, you must:
1. Research current (2024-2025) package versions
2. Look up latest best practices
3. Check for security updates
4. Find modern alternatives to outdated tech

Create these components:

1. research_engine.py - Researches current tech info
2. autonomous_core.py - Main autonomous loop  
3. state_manager.py - Tracks progress
4. validator.py - Tests with current tools
5. knowledge_base.py - Stores research findings
6. main.py - Entry point

The system must:
- Accept natural language goals
- Research before every decision
- Use only current package versions (not training data)
- Build iteratively with validation
- Fix its own errors
- Keep working until successful

Test it by building a simple web app using 2025 technologies.
Document everything with current information.

Start now. Research first, then build.
