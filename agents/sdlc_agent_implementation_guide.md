## Collaboration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential Collaboration
```
Product Manager → System Architect → Frontend/Backend Developers → QA Engineer → DevOps Engineer
```

**Use Case**: New feature development
**Benefits**: Clear handoffs, comprehensive coverage
**Considerations**: May increase time to market

### Pattern 2: Parallel Development
```
Frontend Developer + Backend Developer (working in parallel with API contracts)
```

**Use Case**: API-driven development
**Benefits**: Faster development cycles
**Considerations**: Requires clear API specifications

### Pattern 3: Cross-Functional Review
```
All relevant agents review and provide feedback on each major deliverable
```

**Use Case**: Critical system changes
**Benefits**: Multiple perspectives, higher quality
**Considerations**: May slow down decision-making

### Pattern 4: Specialized Consultation
```
Primary agent consults with specialized agents for specific expertise
```

**Use Case**: Complex technical decisions
**Benefits**: Expert input, informed decisions
**Considerations**: Requires clear consultation protocols
