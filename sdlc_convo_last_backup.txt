  ● Ready for compacting! The critical information is saved in:
    - /home/opsvi/master_root/MERGE_PLAN.md - the exact merge order and rules
    - /home/opsvi/master_root/CONTEXT_STATE.md - current state and context

    After compacting, we can read these files and continue exactly where we left off. <- this was what you said
   before I did that

● I'll check our current status and continue with the branch merging plan.

● Bash(git branch --show-current)
  ⎿  feature/chronological-integration-all

● Bash(git status)

     Untracked files:

● Good, we're on the correct branch. Now I'll start the chronological merge process following the
  MERGE_PLAN.md. Let me begin with the first branch:

● Bash(git merge AUTOSAVE)

     … +56 lines (ctrl+r to see all)

● As expected, we have conflicts. Following the merge plan rules - we'll keep all files and accept the moves to
   .archive/. Let me resolve the conflicts:

● Bash(git status | head -50)
  ⎿  On branch feature/chronological-integration-all
     You have unmerged paths.
       (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
     … +48 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● These are mostly files being moved to .archive/. Since .archive/ is in .gitignore, we'll accept these moves.
  Let me handle the content conflicts first:

● Bash(git status | grep "both")
  ⎿  	both added:      .cursor/mcp.json
     	both added:      .cursor/rules/consult-agent-usage.mdc
     	both modified:   .gitignore
     … +4 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me resolve these conflicts, keeping both sides' changes where appropriate:

● Read(.gitignore)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me check the conflict markers:

● Bash(grep -n "<<<<<<< HEAD" .gitignore)
  ⎿  338:<<<<<<< HEAD

● Read(.gitignore)
  ⎿  Read 22 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I'll resolve all the conflicts. For .gitignore, I'll keep both sides' additions:

● Update(.gitignore)
  ⎿  Updated .gitignore with 4 additions and 7 removals

● Bash(cat .cursor/mcp.json | head -30)

       "mcpServers": {

● Let me view the full file to understand the conflicts:

● Read(.cursor/mcp.json)
  ⎿  Read 134 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I'll merge this keeping the AUTOSAVE version which has the correct module paths and includes the git server:

● Write(.cursor/mcp.json)

● Now let me resolve the other conflict files quickly:

     … +13 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● These are many conflicts. Let me take the AUTOSAVE versions which likely have the more recent changes. Let me
   handle them efficiently:

● Bash(git checkout --theirs .cursor/rules/consult-agent-usage.mdc platform/observability/config/tempo.yaml
      platform/rag/docker-compose.yml systemd/autosave@.service s…)
  ⎿  Updated 5 paths from the index

● Good, now let me add all the resolved files and handle the deletion conflicts. Per the merge plan, we'll
  accept the files being moved to .archive/:

● Bash(git add -u)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Bash(git status | grep "deleted by us" | wc -l)
  ⎿  0
