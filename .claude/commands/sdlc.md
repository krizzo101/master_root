# SDLC Project Initialization with Agent Support

This command initiates a new project following strict SDLC phases with appropriate agent support.

## üéØ Core Principles

### Mandatory Requirements
1. **Check for existing implementations first** - Always use libs/ packages when available
2. **Build reusable components** - Everything goes in libs/ or apps/ with proper structure
3. **Follow current best practices** - Research 2025 patterns, not outdated approaches
4. **Complete each phase fully** - No skipping or partial deliverables
5. **Test everything thoroughly** - Components must actually work, not "mostly work"

## Usage
```
/sdlc <project description>
```

## ü§ñ Agent Strategy for SDLC Phases

### Phase-Specific Agent Profiles
Each SDLC phase has a dedicated agent profile that should be loaded:

| Phase | Agent Profile | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **DISCOVERY** | `sdlc-discovery` | Understand requirements, research solutions |
| **DESIGN** | `sdlc-design` | Create robust, scalable architecture |
| **PLANNING** | `sdlc-planning` | Break down into actionable tasks |
| **DEVELOPMENT** | `sdlc-development` | Implement clean, tested code |
| **TESTING** | `sdlc-testing` | Validate all requirements met |
| **DEPLOYMENT** | `sdlc-deployment` | Prepare for production |
| **PRODUCTION** | `sdlc-production` | Final review and handover |

**Loading Phase Profiles**: Read the appropriate profile from `.claude/agents/` at the start of each phase to align your approach with phase-specific requirements.

## What This Command Does
1. **Initializes SDLC tracking** for your project
2. **Enforces phase progression** (can't skip ahead)
3. **Creates project structure** in the correct location
4. **Tracks deliverables** for each phase
5. **Ensures standards compliance** throughout
6. **Leverages specialized agents** for each phase

## üìö Required Reading
First, familiarize yourself with these critical documents:
1. `/home/opsvi/master_root/CLAUDE.md` - Your behavioral directives (BE THE EXPERT)
2. `/home/opsvi/master_root/docs/guidelines/AGENT_SDLC_GUIDELINES.md` - SDLC phases to follow
3. `/home/opsvi/master_root/docs/standards/MONOREPO_PROJECT_STANDARDS.md` - Project structure standards
4. `/home/opsvi/master_root/docs/standards/AGENT_INVOCATION_STANDARDS.md` - You are Claude Code, handle everything
5. `/home/opsvi/master_root/docs/standards/GIT_WORKFLOW_STANDARDS.md` - Git branching and commit standards

## üåø Git Setup (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
```bash
# Start from main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch for this project
git checkout -b feature/<project-name>

# Verify branch
git branch --show-current
```

## üîç MANDATORY Pre-Development Checks (CANNOT SKIP)

### 1. Knowledge System Query
```python
# Check for existing knowledge using Knowledge MCP tools
result = mcp__knowledge__knowledge_query(
    query_type="search",
    query_text="your search terms",
    knowledge_type="WORKFLOW"  # or ERROR_SOLUTION, CODE_PATTERN, etc.
)
```

### 2. Resource Discovery - Check Existing Code

**IMPORTANT**: The resource discovery MCP server must be configured in your MCP settings to use these tools.

```python
# MANDATORY: Search for existing functionality in libs/
result = mcp__resource_discovery__search_resources(
    functionality="description of what you need",
    search_depth=2,
    include_tests=False
)
# IF FOUND: You MUST use it or document why it won't work

# Check if specific package exists
package_info = mcp__resource_discovery__check_package_exists("opsvi-llm")
# IF EXISTS: You MUST use this package

# Find similar code patterns
similar = mcp__resource_discovery__find_similar_functionality(
    code_snippet="def authenticate_user(username, password):",
    language="python"
)
# IF SIMILAR EXISTS: You MUST extend/compose, not duplicate

### ‚õî STOP GATE: Duplication Check
If similar functionality exists:
1. You MUST use the existing implementation
2. OR extend it to add missing features
3. OR explicitly document why it cannot be used
4. NEVER create a parallel implementation
```

**Note**: These are MCP tools provided by the resource_discovery server. Do NOT try to import Python modules directly.

### 3. External Research and Parallel Processing

#### Research Current Best Practices (MANDATORY)
```python
# Use MCP tools for research - don't skip this!
mcp__mcp_web_search__brave_web_search(
    query="[technology] best practices 2025",
    count=10
)

mcp__tech_docs__get-library-docs(
    context7CompatibleLibraryID="/org/library",
    topic="specific feature"
)
```

#### Parallel Agent Spawning with Task Tool
**Use the Task tool to spawn multiple agents for parallel work:**

```python
# Spawn parallel research agents
Task(
    description="Research authentication patterns",
    subagent_type="research-genius",  # Or use claude-code for complex tasks
    prompt="Find current best practices for JWT authentication in 2025"
)

# For production work
mcp__claude-code__claude_run(
    task="Create JWT authentication with refresh tokens",
    outputFormat="json",
    permissionMode="bypassPermissions"
)
```

**Remember**: Use Task tool whenever you have independent work that can be parallelized. This significantly speeds up development.

## üìã SDLC Phases with Agent Support

### Phase Tracking and Project Management

**DO NOT import Python modules directly!** Use MCP tools and TodoWrite for tracking.

```python
# Track your progress through SDLC phases
TodoWrite(todos=[
    {"id": "1", "content": "DISCOVERY: Gather requirements", "status": "in_progress"},
    {"id": "2", "content": "DESIGN: Create architecture", "status": "pending"},
    {"id": "3", "content": "PLANNING: Break down tasks", "status": "pending"},
    {"id": "4", "content": "DEVELOPMENT: Implement code", "status": "pending"},
    {"id": "5", "content": "TESTING: Validate solution", "status": "pending"},
    {"id": "6", "content": "DEPLOYMENT: Prepare production", "status": "pending"},
    {"id": "7", "content": "PRODUCTION: Final review", "status": "pending"}
])

# Each phase has specific deliverables - mark complete when done
```

### Existing Template System (for reference)
- `/libs/templates.yaml` - 2000+ lines of templates
- `/libs/generate_ecosystem_v2.py` - Mass scaffolding generator
- `/libs/recommended_structure.yaml` - Structure definitions

## ‚ö° Key Principles
1. **Research First**: Always check current (2025) best practices
2. **Don't Reinvent**: Check libs/ before building anything
3. **Over-Modularize**: Many small modules > few large ones
4. **Test Everything**: TDD is mandatory, >80% coverage
5. **Document Always**: README, API docs, inline comments
6. **Commit Often**: After each logical unit of work
7. **Use Agents**: Leverage specialized agents for each phase

## üõë Definition of "Done"

### Each phase must be complete before proceeding:
1. **All deliverables created** - No missing documents or code
2. **Tests pass** - All unit, integration, and e2e tests green
3. **Documentation complete** - README, API docs, examples included
4. **Code follows standards** - Linting, type hints, proper structure
5. **Peer review passed** - Use reviewer-critic agent if needed
6. **Integration verified** - Can be imported and used by other projects
7. **Knowledge captured** - Lessons learned documented in knowledge system

## Next Steps
After reading this document:
1. Begin with Phase 1: DISCOVERY
2. Complete ALL activities and deliverables for each phase
3. Do not proceed to next phase until current phase is complete
4. Use the specified MCP tools and agents for each phase

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Pre-commit Hook Errors
If you get pre-commit errors, ensure `.pre-commit-config.yaml` exists:
```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run manually
pre-commit run --all-files

# Or bypass temporarily
PRE_COMMIT_ALLOW_NO_CONFIG=1 git commit -m "message"
```

### Resource Discovery
Use the Task tool with research-genius agent instead of direct Python imports:
```python
# Don't use: from opsvi_mcp.tools.resource_discovery import ResourceDiscovery
# Use: Task tool as shown above
```

Now, what are we building?
