        Provide a comprehensive analysis including:
        
        1. INTENT ANALYSIS:
           - What is the user's true intent?
           - What problem are they trying to solve?
           - What is the core business value?
        
        2. USER ANALYSIS:

           - Who are the secondary users?
           - What are their skill levels?
           - What are their expectations?
        
        3. REQUIREMENTS EXTRACTION:
           a) Functional Requirements (explicit):
              - What features are directly mentioned?
              - What capabilities are requested?

           - What technologies are most suitable?
           - What are the technical challenges?
           - What integrations might be needed?
        
        5. COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT:
           - How complex is this project? (simple/medium/complex/enterprise)
           - What makes it complex?
           - How long would it take to build?
           - What skills are required?
