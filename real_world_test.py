    Create a production-ready microservice for user authentication with the following requirements:

    1. REST API with FastAPI for user registration, login, and token refresh
    2. JWT token authentication with proper expiration and refresh logic
    3. Password hashing using bcrypt with salt rounds
    4. SQLite database with SQLAlchemy ORM for user storage
    5. Input validation using Pydantic models
    6. Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
    7. Logging with proper error handling and audit trails
    8. Health check endpoint for monitoring
    9. Docker containerization with proper security practices
    10. Unit tests with pytest covering all endpoints

    The service should be secure, scalable, and follow Python best practices.
    Include proper error handling, input sanitization, and security headers.
