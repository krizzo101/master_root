# V3 Server - Actual Behavior Analysis

## What V3 ACTUALLY Does

Based on code analysis and testing, here's what V3 really does:

### Task Decomposition ✅
V3 successfully decomposes complex tasks:
- Tasks with complexity > 2 ("complex" or "very_complex") trigger decomposition
- A "very_complex" REST API task decomposed into **7 subtasks**
- Each subtask represents a component (models, endpoints, tests, etc.)

### Execution Pattern: **SEQUENTIAL, NOT PARALLEL** ⚠️

The critical finding from the code:

```python
# From server.py lines 199-214
if subtasks and len(subtasks) > 1:
    # Execute subtasks sequentially (could be parallelized)
    results = []
    for i, subtask in enumerate(subtasks):
        result = await execute_claude_code(
            task_desc,
            mode=execution_mode.name,
            timeout=timeout_seconds // len(subtasks),
            output_format="json"
        )
```

**V3 executes subtasks ONE AT A TIME in a loop!**

## How Many Instances Are Spawned?

### For Simple Tasks (complexity ≤ 2):
- **1 Claude instance** - Direct execution, no decomposition

### For Complex Tasks (complexity > 2):
- **N Claude instances** where N = number of subtasks
- But they run **SEQUENTIALLY**, not simultaneously
- Each waits for the previous to complete

## Example: REST API Task

When given "Create a complete REST API server", V3:

1. **Decomposes** into 7 subtasks:
   - Create directory structure
   - Create config.py
   - Create models.py
   - Implement server.py
   - Implement MCP tools
   - Create __init__ and __main__
   - Create tests

2. **Executes** each subtask:
   - Calls Claude #1: "Create directory structure" → Waits for completion
   - Calls Claude #2: "Create config.py" → Waits for completion
   - Calls Claude #3: "Create models.py" → Waits for completion
   - ... and so on

3. **Time Impact**:
   - If each Claude call takes ~5 seconds
   - Total time: 7 × 5 = **35 seconds minimum**
   - Plus overhead = 40-60+ seconds

## Depth/Levels

**V3 has NO recursion or depth!**
- All subtasks are at the same level
- No subtask spawns further subtasks
- It's a flat, sequential execution model

## The Reality vs. The Promise

### What We Expected:
```
Task → Decompose → Spawn 7 parallel agents → Fast completion
         ↓
    [Agent1] [Agent2] [Agent3] ... [Agent7]
    (all running simultaneously)
```

### What Actually Happens:
```
Task → Decompose → Agent1 → Agent2 → Agent3 → ... → Agent7
                    (wait)   (wait)   (wait)         (wait)
```

## Performance Implications

### V3 is SLOWER than V1 for complex tasks!

- **V1**: Single Claude call with full context
- **V3**: Multiple Claude calls with divided context

For a 7-subtask decomposition:
- **V1**: 1 call × 5 seconds = 5 seconds
- **V3**: 7 calls × 5 seconds = 35 seconds

## Why the Tests Timed Out

The complex REST API test timed out because:
1. Decomposed into 7 subtasks
2. Each subtask makes a real Claude API call
3. Sequential execution means 7× the time
4. Exceeded our 60-120 second timeouts

## V3's Actual Value Proposition

V3 is NOT about speed. It's about:

1. **Structured Decomposition**: Breaking complex tasks into manageable pieces
2. **Quality Through Specialization**: Each subtask gets focused attention
3. **Cost Tracking**: Per-subtask cost visibility
4. **Failure Isolation**: If one subtask fails, others may succeed

But it comes at a cost:
- **Much slower** than single execution
- **Higher API costs** (multiple calls)
- **No parallelism** despite the architecture suggesting it

## The Missing Piece: V2

This is where V2 (fire-and-forget) SHOULD excel:
- V2 is designed for parallel execution
- Could spawn 7 agents simultaneously
- But V2 was also stubbed (now fixed)

## Summary

**V3 Actual Behavior:**
- ✅ Decomposes complex tasks (works)
- ✅ Executes multiple Claude instances (works)
- ❌ NO parallel execution (sequential only)
- ❌ NO recursion/depth (flat execution)
- ❌ SLOWER than V1 for complex tasks

**Number of Instances:**
- Simple task: 1 instance
- Complex task: N instances (where N = subtask count)
- Execution: Sequential, not parallel

**Recommendation:**
- Use V3 for quality and structure, not speed
- Use V1 for simple/fast tasks
- Consider V2 for true parallel execution (now that it's fixed)
