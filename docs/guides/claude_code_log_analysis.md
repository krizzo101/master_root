# Claude Code MCP Server Log Analysis Report

## Log File Analyzed
- **File**: `/home/opsvi/master_root/logs/claude-code/parallel-execution-1755088405.log`
- **Time Period**: 2025-08-13 08:33:25 - 08:44:08
- **Total Events**: 28 log entries

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Recursion Limit Exceeded
- **Error at 08:40:00**: `ValueError: Too many concurrent jobs at depth 0: 5/5`
- **Impact**: New job creation failed when trying to exceed the configured limit of 5 concurrent jobs at depth 0
- **Configuration**: 
  - Max depth: 3
  - Max concurrent at depth: 5
  - Max total jobs: 20

### 2. Multiple Job Timeouts
Five jobs timed out after 300 seconds (5 minutes):

1. **Job ba126274** (08:43:03) - Database Integration MCP Server creation
2. **Job 034864f4** (08:43:19) - Monitoring & Observability MCP Server creation
3. **Job 8915553c** (08:43:36) - Context Bridge server fix
4. **Job b7511048** (08:43:52) - Template TODOs completion
5. **Job 9cc4ffe5** (08:44:08) - Testing & QA MCP Server creation

### 3. Pattern Analysis

#### Concurrent Execution Pattern
- 5 jobs were spawned within ~1.5 minutes (08:38:03 - 08:39:08)
- All jobs were complex server creation/modification tasks
- Each job spawned a Claude Code process with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`

#### Timeout Pattern
- All 5 jobs hit the 300-second timeout
- Timeouts occurred sequentially as recursion contexts were cleaned up
- Recursion cleanup showed decreasing "remaining_at_depth" (5→4→3→2→1→0)

## Root Causes

### 1. Resource Saturation
- The server hit its concurrent job limit (5) at depth 0
- This prevented any new jobs from being created until existing ones completed

### 2. Long-Running Tasks
- All tasks were complex server creation operations requiring:
  - Multiple file creation
  - Code generation
  - Configuration setup
  - Error handling implementation

### 3. Configuration Limitations
Current settings may be too restrictive:
- 5 concurrent jobs at depth 0
- 300-second timeout may be insufficient for complex code generation tasks

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Increase timeout** for complex tasks (e.g., 600-900 seconds)
2. **Increase concurrent job limit** at depth 0 (e.g., 8-10)
3. **Monitor resource usage** (CPU, memory) during peak loads

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Implement task prioritization** to handle critical jobs first
2. **Add job queuing** when limits are reached instead of failing
3. **Implement progressive timeout** based on task complexity
4. **Add job cancellation** capabilities for stuck processes
5. **Enhance logging** with:
   - Progress indicators for long-running tasks
   - Resource usage metrics
   - Task complexity estimation

### Configuration Optimization
```json
{
  "CLAUDE_MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH": "3",
  "CLAUDE_MAX_CONCURRENT_AT_DEPTH": "8",  // Increased from 5
  "CLAUDE_MAX_TOTAL_JOBS": "30",          // Increased from 20
  "CLAUDE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS": "600"         // Increased from 300
}
```

## Server Health Status
- **Overall Status**: Operational with capacity constraints
- **Error Rate**: 1 error (concurrent limit) + 5 timeouts in ~11 minutes
- **Success Rate**: Unable to determine (no completion logs in this sample)
- **Recommendation**: Monitor after configuration adjustments

## Additional Observations
- All spawned processes used `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag
- JSON output format was consistently used
- Working directory was consistently `/home/opsvi/master_root/libs/opsvi-mcp`
- All tasks involved creating or modifying MCP servers using FastMCP framework
