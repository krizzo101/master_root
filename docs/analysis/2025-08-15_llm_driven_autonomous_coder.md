# LLM-Driven Autonomous Coder Architecture

## Executive Summary

The current autonomous coder uses primitive keyword matching and static templates. This document presents a redesigned architecture that leverages LLM intelligence at every decision point.

## Problems with Current Approach

### 1. Keyword Matching for Project Type
```python
# CURRENT - Primitive pattern matching
if "api" in description.lower():
    project_type = ProjectType.REST_API
elif "dashboard" in description.lower():
    project_type = ProjectType.DASHBOARD
```

**Issues**:
- Misses context and nuance
- Can't handle complex descriptions
- No understanding of actual requirements
- Rigid categorization

### 2. Static Feature Detection
```python
# CURRENT - Simple keyword scanning
feature_keywords = {
    "auth": ["auth", "login", "user"],
    "database": ["database", "db", "data"]
}
```

**Issues**:
- Misses implied requirements
- Can't understand relationships
- No contextual understanding
- Binary detection (has/doesn't have)

### 3. Template-Based Generation
```python
# CURRENT - Fixed templates
def _generate_simple_app(self, path, tech_stack):
    # Hardcoded structure
    self._write_file(path / "package.json", template)
```

**Issues**:
- One-size-fits-all approach
- No adaptation to specific needs
- Outdated patterns
- Limited creativity

## LLM-Driven Architecture

### Core Principle: Intelligence Over Patterns

Replace ALL keyword matching and template logic with LLM intelligence:

```python
# OLD WAY - Keyword matching
if "auth" in description:
    features.append("authentication")

# NEW WAY - LLM understanding
response = await llm.analyze("""
    Understand what this project needs.
    Consider implied requirements.
    Think about user experience.
    Identify technical challenges.
""")
```

### 1. Intelligent Requirements Analysis

Instead of keyword matching, the LLM:

```python
async def _llm_analyze_requirements(self, request):
    prompt = """
    Analyze this request deeply:
    - What problem does it solve?
    - Who are the users?
    - What's the core purpose?
    - What's implied but not stated?
    - What would make this excellent?
    
    Think step by step. Consider modern best practices.
    Don't just match keywords - understand intent.
    """
```

**Benefits**:
- Understands context and nuance
- Identifies implied requirements
- Considers user experience
- Suggests improvements

### 2. Intelligent Research Planning

LLM decides what to research:

```python
async def _llm_plan_research(self, requirements):
    prompt = """
    Based on requirements, what should we research?
    - What technologies fit best?
    - What are the trade-offs?
    - What alternatives exist?
    - What risks should we investigate?
    
    Create a research strategy, not a keyword list.
    """
```

**Benefits**:
- Strategic research vs random lookups
- Considers alternatives
- Evaluates trade-offs
- Risk-aware decisions

### 3. Intelligent Architecture Design

LLM designs the system:

```python
async def _llm_design_architecture(self, requirements, research):
    prompt = """
    Design the architecture:
    - Consider scalability
    - Plan for maintenance
    - Design for testability
    - Think about user experience
    
    Create a thoughtful design, not a template match.
    """
```

**Benefits**:
- Custom architecture per project
- Considers non-functional requirements
- Modern patterns and practices
- Scalability built-in

### 4. Intelligent Code Generation

LLM generates code without templates:

```python
async def _llm_generate_code(self, spec):
    prompt = """
    Generate production-ready code:
    - Follow best practices for 2025
    - Include error handling
    - Make it maintainable
    - Consider edge cases
    
    Write actual code, not filled templates.
    """
```

**Benefits**:
- Custom code for each use case
- Modern patterns and idioms
- Proper error handling
- No template limitations

### 5. Intelligent Validation

LLM reviews generated code:

```python
async def _llm_validate_code(self, code):
    prompt = """
    Review this code:
    - Check for bugs
    - Evaluate security
    - Assess performance
    - Suggest improvements
    
    Think like a senior engineer doing code review.
    """
```

**Benefits**:
- Contextual validation
- Security awareness
- Performance considerations
- Improvement suggestions

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Parallel Implementation
1. Keep existing orchestrator
2. Implement LLMOrchestrator alongside
3. Compare outputs
4. Measure quality improvements

### Phase 2: Gradual Migration
1. Replace requirements analysis first
2. Then research planning
3. Then architecture design
4. Finally, code generation

### Phase 3: Full Integration
1. Remove keyword matching
2. Remove static templates
3. Full LLM-driven pipeline
4. Continuous learning from outcomes

## Integration Points

### With MCP Servers

```python
# LLM decides what to search
research_plan = await llm.plan_research(requirements)

# Execute research based on LLM plan
for topic in research_plan["topics"]:
    if topic["source"] == "documentation":
        results = await context7.get_docs(topic["query"])
    elif topic["source"] == "current_versions":
        results = await brave.search(topic["query"])
    elif topic["source"] == "implementation_examples":
        results = await firecrawl.extract(topic["url"])
```

### With Claude API

```python
from anthropic import Claude

async def _call_llm(self, prompt):
    response = await claude.complete(
        prompt=prompt,
        model="claude-3-opus",
        temperature=0.7,  # Some creativity
        max_tokens=4000
    )
    return response.text
```

## Advantages

### 1. **Contextual Understanding**
- Understands "build something like Twitter but for book readers"
- Identifies that a "dashboard" might need real-time updates
- Knows that "simple app" might still need proper architecture

### 2. **Adaptive Generation**
- Generates React hooks for React projects
- Uses FastAPI patterns for Python APIs
- Adapts to project size and complexity

### 3. **Implicit Requirements**
- Adds error boundaries even if not requested
- Includes accessibility features
- Sets up proper TypeScript configs

### 4. **Modern Practices**
- Always uses latest patterns
- Includes security best practices
- Proper error handling by default

### 5. **Learning and Improvement**
- Each project makes system smarter
- Learns from successes and failures
- Adapts to new technologies

## Example: TODO App Request

### Old System (Keyword-Based)
```
Input: "Build a TODO app"
Process:
1. Keyword "todo" → Simple app template
2. No "database" keyword → Local storage
3. Apply template → Generic TODO app
Output: Basic template-based app
```

### New System (LLM-Driven)
```
Input: "Build a TODO app"
LLM Analysis:
1. "User wants task management"
2. "Probably needs persistence"
3. "Should have good UX"
4. "Might want categories, priorities"
5. "Should work offline"

LLM Decision:
- Use React with TypeScript
- Add IndexedDB for offline
- Include drag-and-drop
- Add keyboard shortcuts
- Implement undo/redo
- Add data export

Output: Thoughtful, feature-rich TODO app
```

## Conclusion

Moving from keyword matching to LLM intelligence transforms the autonomous coder from a template system to an intelligent architect. Every decision becomes thoughtful, contextual, and adaptive.

The system will:
- Understand intent, not just keywords
- Generate custom solutions, not templates
- Adapt to requirements, not force patterns
- Improve with use, not stay static

This is the difference between a script that fills in blanks and an AI that truly understands and creates software.
