# SDLC-Based Autonomous Coder Lifecycle

## Executive Summary

The autonomous coder should follow a proper Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to ensure professional-grade software delivery. This document outlines a comprehensive SDLC workflow that the LLM agent progresses through.

## Why SDLC Matters for AI-Generated Code

### Current Problem
The existing autonomous coder jumps directly from requirements to code generation, missing critical phases:
- No proper planning or stakeholder analysis
- No formal design phase
- Limited testing strategy
- No deployment preparation
- Missing documentation

### SDLC Solution
A structured lifecycle ensures:
- **Completeness**: All aspects of software development are addressed
- **Quality**: Each phase has quality gates
- **Professionalism**: Deliverables match industry standards
- **Maintainability**: Proper documentation and planning for future
- **Risk Management**: Issues identified and mitigated early

## The 8-Phase SDLC Workflow

## Implementation Strategy

### Temperature Control per Phase
Different phases require different LLM behaviors:

```python
llm_temperature = {
    "planning": 0.7,        # Creative thinking
    "requirements": 0.3,    # Precision needed
    "design": 0.6,          # Balanced creativity
    "implementation": 0.4,  # Consistent code
    "testing": 0.2,         # Rigorous testing
    "deployment": 0.1,      # Careful configuration
    "documentation": 0.3,   # Clear writing
    "maintenance": 0.5      # Forward thinking
}
```

### Quality Gates
Each phase must pass quality review before proceeding:

```python
async def quality_gate_review(phase, artifacts):
    review = await llm.review(f"""
        Review {phase} deliverables:
        1. Are they complete?
        2. Do they meet standards?
        3. What risks remain?
        4. Should we proceed?
    """)
    
    if not review.passed:
        await fix_issues(review.issues)
    
    return review.passed
```

### Artifact Management
All phase outputs are stored as artifacts:

```python
@dataclass
class PhaseArtifact:
    phase: SDLCPhase
    type: str
    content: Any
    timestamp: datetime
    approved: bool
    review_notes: List[str]
```

## Conclusion

By following a proper SDLC, the autonomous coder transforms from a code generator into a complete software development system. Each phase ensures critical aspects aren't overlooked, quality is maintained, and the final product is truly production-ready.

The LLM agent becomes not just a coder, but a:
- Project Manager (Planning)
- Business Analyst (Requirements)
- Software Architect (Design)
- Developer (Implementation)
- QA Engineer (Testing)
- DevOps Engineer (Deployment)
- Technical Writer (Documentation)
- Support Engineer (Maintenance)

This comprehensive approach ensures the software built is not just functional, but professional, maintainable, and ready for real-world use.
