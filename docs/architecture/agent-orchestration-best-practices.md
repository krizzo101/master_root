# Agent Orchestration Best Practices & Anti-Patterns
## Comprehensive Guide for Production SDLC Automation

### Executive Summary
Based on extensive research into distributed systems, multi-agent orchestration, and production implementations, this document compiles critical best practices and anti-patterns for building robust agent-based SDLC automation.

## Best Practices

### 1. Architecture & Design

#### ✅ DO: Start Small, Scale Incrementally
- Begin with 2-3 agents in high-value workflows
- Establish baseline metrics before scaling
- Add complexity only after proving base functionality
- **Evidence**: Enterprises see 45% faster problem resolution with gradual adoption

#### ✅ DO: Choose the Right Orchestration Pattern
- **Hub-and-Spoke**: For centralized control and simple workflows
- **Mesh Architecture**: For resilient, decentralized operations
- **Hybrid**: For combining strategic coordination with tactical autonomy
- **Saga Pattern**: For distributed transactions with compensation logic

#### ✅ DO: Implement Checkpoint-Based Recovery
- Save agent state every 2-3 minutes
- Store checkpoints in durable storage (not memory)
- Include enough context to resume from any point
- Design for idempotent operations

#### ✅ DO: Use Git Worktrees for Isolation
```bash
# Each agent gets isolated workspace
git worktree add -b agent-dev-1 ../worktrees/dev-1
```
- Prevents merge conflicts during parallel execution
- Enables clean rollback on failure
- Maintains clear audit trail per agent

### 2. Communication & Protocols

#### ✅ DO: Select Appropriate Communication Protocol
- **MCP**: For LLM-tool integration (JSON-RPC, secure invocation)
- **ACP**: For rich multimodal messaging between agents
- **A2A**: For enterprise task delegation and orchestration
- **ANP**: For decentralized, cross-platform agent markets

#### ✅ DO: Implement Event-Driven Communication
- Use message queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ) for async communication
- Design for eventual consistency
- Enable replay capability for debugging
- Implement circuit breakers for failing services

### 3. Error Handling & Recovery

#### ✅ DO: Design for Failure
- Assume agents will timeout (hard limit: 10 minutes)
- Implement compensation workflows (Saga pattern)
- Create fallback strategies for every critical path
- Enable graceful degradation to simpler workflows

#### ✅ DO: Implement Comprehensive Monitoring
```python
# Track key metrics
metrics = {
    "execution_time": duration_minutes,
    "token_usage": tokens_consumed,
    "checkpoint_count": checkpoints_saved,
    "retry_attempts": retry_count,
    "success_rate": success_count / total_count
}
```

### 4. Performance & Optimization

#### ✅ DO: Parallelize Intelligently
- Limit to 3-5 concurrent agents (system resource constraints)
- Use task decomposition to break work into 5-10 minute chunks
- Implement dynamic scaling based on system load
- Monitor inter-agent call depth

#### ✅ DO: Optimize Model Selection
```python
model_selection = {
    "simple_tasks": "claude-3-haiku",     # Fast, cost-effective
    "complex_tasks": "claude-3-sonnet",   # Balanced capability
    "synthesis_tasks": "claude-3-opus"    # Maximum capability
}
```

### 5. Knowledge Management

#### ✅ DO: Capture and Reuse Patterns
- Store successful workflows in knowledge base
- Track reliability scores (success/failure ratio)
- Version control knowledge evolution
- Create indexes for fast pattern retrieval

#### ✅ DO: Implement Structured Context
- Use proper JSON/map structures, not strings
- Include SDLC phase metadata
- Track agent type compatibility
- Maintain relationship graphs (DEPENDS_ON, COMPENSATES)

## Anti-Patterns

### 1. Architecture Anti-Patterns

#### ❌ DON'T: Big Bang Implementation
- **Problem**: Trying to automate entire SDLC at once
- **Impact**: Overwhelming complexity, high failure rate
- **Solution**: Incremental adoption, phase-by-phase automation

#### ❌ DON'T: Monolithic Orchestrator
- **Problem**: Single point of failure controlling all agents
- **Impact**: System-wide outages, scaling bottlenecks
- **Solution**: Distributed coordination with fallback mechanisms

#### ❌ DON'T: Ignore Timeout Boundaries
- **Problem**: Agents running indefinitely without checkpoints
- **Impact**: Lost work, context overflow, resource exhaustion
- **Solution**: Hard 10-minute limits with checkpoint recovery

### 2. Communication Anti-Patterns

#### ❌ DON'T: Synchronous Agent Chains
```python
# Anti-pattern: Sequential waiting
result1 = agent1.execute_and_wait()
result2 = agent2.execute_and_wait()  # Blocks unnecessarily
result3 = agent3.execute_and_wait()
```
- **Solution**: Async execution with event-driven coordination

#### ❌ DON'T: Direct Agent-to-Agent Dependencies
- **Problem**: Tight coupling between agents
- **Impact**: Cascading failures, difficult testing
- **Solution**: Message-based communication through queues

### 3. Error Handling Anti-Patterns

#### ❌ DON'T: Silent Failures
- **Problem**: Agents failing without proper error propagation
- **Impact**: Corrupted state, incomplete workflows
- **Solution**: Explicit error handling with compensation logic

#### ❌ DON'T: Infinite Retry Loops
```python
# Anti-pattern: No retry limit
while not success:
    retry()  # Can run forever
```
- **Solution**: Exponential backoff with maximum retry count

### 4. Resource Management Anti-Patterns

#### ❌ DON'T: Unbounded Parallelism
- **Problem**: Spawning unlimited concurrent agents
- **Impact**: Resource exhaustion, token limit violations
- **Solution**: Resource pools with queue management

#### ❌ DON'T: Context Accumulation
- **Problem**: Passing entire conversation history between agents
- **Impact**: Token overflow, degraded performance
- **Solution**: Context summarization and selective passing

### 5. Knowledge Management Anti-Patterns

#### ❌ DON'T: Unstructured Context Storage
```python
# Anti-pattern: Everything as strings
context = json.dumps(complex_object)  # Loses queryability
```
- **Solution**: Proper graph properties and relationships

#### ❌ DON'T: No Version Control
- **Problem**: Overwriting knowledge without history
- **Impact**: Lost improvements, inability to rollback
- **Solution**: SUPERSEDES relationships with migration notes
