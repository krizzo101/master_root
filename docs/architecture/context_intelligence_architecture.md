# Context Intelligence Architecture Design
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Date**: 2025-08-15  
**Status**: Design Phase  
**Author**: Claude with Human Collaboration

## Executive Summary

Context Intelligence is a hybrid RAG-based system that enhances Claude's ability to understand and work with complex codebases by providing semantic search, intelligent context selection, and cross-project learning capabilities while maintaining performance under strict token constraints.

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations
1. **Token Window Constraints**: Limited to ~200K tokens, forcing shallow analysis of large projects
2. **No Semantic Understanding**: Current systems use keyword matching, missing conceptual relationships
3. **No Cross-Session Memory**: Each conversation starts fresh with no learning from previous interactions
4. **Inefficient Context Loading**: Full file loading wastes tokens on irrelevant content
5. **No Cross-Project Learning**: Patterns discovered in one project don't benefit others

### Impact
- 10x slower analysis due to repeated searches
- Missing critical relationships between code elements
- Inability to learn and improve over time
- Token waste on irrelevant context
- Repeated solving of similar problems

## Proposed Solution: Hybrid Context Intelligence

```

### Key Design Principles
1. **Local-First**: Each project maintains its own vector database for privacy and performance
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add features incrementally
3. **Token-Aware**: All operations optimize for minimal token consumption
4. **Performance-Critical**: Sub-100ms response times for most queries
5. **Learning-Enabled**: Continuous improvement from usage patterns

## Technical Architecture

### Component Stack

#### Layer 1: Vector Database (RAG Foundation)
- **Technology**: ChromaDB (primary) or Qdrant (alternative)
- **Embedding Model**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (fast, efficient, 384 dimensions)
- **Chunk Strategy**: 
  - Code: 512 tokens with 128 overlap
  - Documentation: 1024 tokens with 256 overlap
  - Comments: Preserved with parent code
- **Metadata Schema**:
  ```json
  {
    "file_path": "str",
    "file_type": "source|test|config|doc",
    "language": "str",
    "imports": ["list"],
    "exported_symbols": ["list"],
    "line_start": "int",
    "line_end": "int",
    "last_modified": "datetime",
    "semantic_type": "function|class|module|config"
  }
  ```

#### Layer 2: Semantic Graph
- **Technology**: NetworkX for in-memory graph
- **Node Types**:
  - Files
  - Functions/Methods
  - Classes
  - Modules
  - Concepts (extracted from comments/docs)
- **Edge Types**:
  - imports
  - calls
  - inherits
  - implements
  - semantically_similar (from embeddings)
- **Graph Operations**:
  - Impact analysis (what breaks if X changes)
  - Dependency traversal
  - Pattern detection

#### Layer 3: Intelligence Engine
- **Query Optimization**:
  ```python
  class QueryOptimizer:
      def optimize(self, query: str, token_budget: int):
          # 1. Semantic search for relevant chunks
          # 2. Graph traversal for relationships
          # 3. Ranking by relevance + importance
          # 4. Compression to fit token budget
          return optimized_context
  ```
- **Learning System**:
  - Track which contexts lead to successful outcomes
  - Adjust embedding weights based on usage
  - Build query-to-context mappings

#### Layer 4: MCP Integration
- **Tool Interface**:
  ```python
  @mcp_tool
  async def search_context(
      query: str,
      scope: Literal["local", "related", "global"],
      token_budget: int = 2000,
      intent: Optional[str] = None  # understand|implement|debug|refactor
  ) -> ContextResult
  ```

### Integration Points

#### With Existing Gatekeeper (libs/gatekeeper/)
- **Extension Point**: Add semantic search to `AutoAttach.find_related_files()`
- **Enhancement**: Use embeddings for similarity beyond imports
- **Preservation**: Keep O(1) lookups, add vector similarity as enhancement

#### With ACCF ConsultGatekeeper
- **Integration Point**: `AutoGenIntegration._call_autogen_utility()`
- **Key Enhancement**:
  ```python
  def _call_autogen_utility(self, request, deadline_ms):
      # Existing rule-based selection
      base_results = super()._call_autogen_utility(request, deadline_ms)
      
      # Add semantic enhancement (if time permits)
      if deadline_ms > 20:
          semantic_results = self.vector_engine.search(
              query=request.intent,
              timeout_ms=deadline_ms - 10
          )
          base_results.merge_semantic(semantic_results)
      
      return base_results
  ```

#### With Project Intelligence (.proj-intel/)
- **Data Source**: Use existing indices for initial embeddings
- **Synchronization**: Refresh embeddings when project intelligence updates
- **Augmentation**: Add semantic relationships to existing structural data

## Implementation Strategy

**Goal**: Basic semantic search working locally

1. **Day 1-2**: Core RAG Implementation
   ```python
   class LocalContextEngine:
       def __init__(self, project_root: Path):
           self.vector_db = chromadb.PersistentClient(
               path=project_root / ".context-vectors"
           )
           self.embedder = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
       
       def embed_project(self):
           # Embed .proj-intel data
           # Chunk and embed source files
           # Store with metadata
   ```

2. **Day 3-4**: MCP Tool Wrapper
   ```python
   @mcp.tool
   async def search_project(query: str, limit: int = 10):
       engine = LocalContextEngine(detect_project_root())
       results = await engine.search(query, limit)
       return compress_for_tokens(results)
   ```

3. **Day 5**: Testing & Validation

```

## Migration Path

### From Current State
1. **Keep Existing Systems**: Gatekeeper and .proj-intel continue working
2. **Add Enhancement Layer**: Vector DB runs alongside
3. **Gradual Adoption**: Tools can opt-in to semantic search
4. **Full Integration**: Eventually becomes primary context system

### Rollback Plan
- Vector DB can be disabled, falling back to keyword search
- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to current tools

## Future Enhancements

### Near Term (3-6 months)
1. **Multi-language Support**: Beyond Python
2. **IDE Integration**: VSCode extension for context
3. **Real-time Updates**: Watch for file changes
4. **Team Sharing**: Shared team knowledge base

### Long Term (6-12 months)  
1. **AI-Native Refactoring**: Understand refactoring impact
2. **Automated Documentation**: Generate from understanding
3. **Code Generation**: Context-aware code synthesis
4. **Architectural Analysis**: System-level understanding

## Conclusion

Context Intelligence represents a paradigm shift in how AI agents interact with codebases. By combining semantic understanding, intelligent retrieval, and continuous learning, we can achieve 10-100x improvement in Claude's ability to understand and modify complex systems while staying within token constraints.

The hybrid architecture ensures we get immediate value from local implementations while building toward a future of shared intelligence across all projects.
