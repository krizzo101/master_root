# SDLC Enforcement Framework for AI Agents

## Overview
This framework ensures all AI agents follow a rigorous Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) process when implementing solutions, preventing rework, failures, and ensuring production-ready quality from the start.

## Core Principles
1. **Fail-Fast Validation**: Catch issues early in the process
2. **Progressive Elaboration**: Start high-level, refine iteratively
3. **Checkpoint Enforcement**: Cannot proceed without passing gates
4. **Knowledge Integration**: Learn from past successes and failures
5. **Automated Quality Assurance**: Built-in testing and validation

## The 7-Phase SDLC Process

### Phase 1: DISCOVERY & REQUIREMENTS (Mandatory First Step)
**Duration**: 10-15% of total project time
**Gate Requirements**: Must complete ALL before proceeding

#### Checklist:

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### 1. Pre-Flight Checks (Before Starting)
```python
def pre_flight_check(project_name):
    checks = {
        "knowledge_queried": False,
        "requirements_documented": False,
        "architecture_reviewed": False,
        "risks_assessed": False,
        "dependencies_mapped": False
    }
    return all(checks.values())
```

### 2. Progressive Gates (Cannot Skip)
Each phase must be completed and validated before moving to the next. No shortcuts allowed.

### 3. Automated Validation
- Use MCP tools to validate each phase
- Automatic rollback if quality gates fail
- Continuous monitoring of compliance

### 4. Knowledge Integration
- Query before starting (mandatory)
- Store learnings after completion (mandatory)
- Update patterns and best practices

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Technical Debt Traps:
1. **Skipping architecture phase** → Technical debt explosion
2. **Insufficient testing** → Production failures
3. **No rollback plan** → Deployment disasters
4. **Ignoring non-functional requirements** → Performance issues
5. **No monitoring** → Blind in production

### Process Failures:
1. **Starting coding immediately** → Wrong solution
2. **No stakeholder alignment** → Requirement misses
3. **Skipping knowledge check** → Repeating mistakes
4. **No documentation** → Maintenance nightmare
5. **Ignoring security** → Vulnerabilities in production

## Implementation as MCP Tool

### Tool: `sdlc_enforcer`
```python
class SDLCEnforcer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.phases = [
            "discovery",
            "design",
            "planning",
            "development",
            "testing",
            "deployment",
            "production"
        ]
        self.current_phase = None
        self.completed_phases = []
        
    def start_project(self, project_name, description):
        # Force discovery phase first
        self.current_phase = "discovery"
        # Query knowledge system
        # Create project structure
        # Initialize tracking
        
    def validate_phase(self, phase_name):
        # Check all deliverables
        # Run quality gates
        # Return pass/fail with reasons
        
    def proceed_to_next_phase(self):
        # Only if current phase validated
        # Update tracking
        # Initialize next phase requirements
```

## Metrics for Success

### Quality Metrics:
- **First-Time Success Rate**: > 90%
- **Rework Percentage**: < 10%
- **Production Incidents**: < 1 per deployment
- **Code Coverage**: > 80%
- **Technical Debt Ratio**: < 5%

### Process Metrics:
- **Phase Completion Rate**: 100% (no skipping)
- **Gate Passage Rate**: Track failures and reasons
- **Knowledge Reuse**: > 50% from existing patterns
- **Documentation Completeness**: 100%
- **Rollback Success Rate**: 100%

## Emergency Protocols

### When Things Go Wrong:
1. **STOP** - Don't compound the problem
2. **ASSESS** - What failed and why?
3. **ROLLBACK** - Return to last known good state
4. **ANALYZE** - Root cause analysis
5. **LEARN** - Update knowledge system
6. **RETRY** - With improvements

## Integration with Existing Tools

### Required MCP Tools:
- `knowledge_system`: Query and store learnings
- `todo_write`: Track phase progress
- `git`: Version control at each phase
- `testing_framework`: Automated validation
- `monitoring`: Production observability

### Workflow Integration:
1. Agent receives request
2. SDLC Enforcer activated
3. Phases executed in order
4. Gates enforced automatically
5. Knowledge system updated
6. Success metrics tracked

## Conclusion
This framework ensures that every project follows a disciplined approach, reducing failures and rework while improving quality and maintainability. No agent should begin implementation without completing the discovery and design phases.

**Remember**: "Measure twice, cut once" - proper planning prevents poor performance.
